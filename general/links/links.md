### QTL Mapping Resources

* <a href="http://compbio.uthsc.edu/QSB/" target="_blank">**QSB**</a>: QSB is a stand-alone JAVA program with a sophisticated GUI developed for genetical genomics or systems genetics, an emerging field that combines quantitative genetics and genomics. QSB stands for QTL mapping, Sequence polymorphism analysis (or SNP analysis) and Bayesian network analysis. QSB takes marker and array data from a segregating population as input and identifies significant QTLs and then evaluated networks of candidate genes associated with these QTLs.

* <a href="http://qtlreaper.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">**QTL Reaper**</a>  is software, written in C and compiled as a Python module, for rapidly scanning microarray expression data for QTLs. It is essentially the batch-oriented version of WebQTL. It requires, as input, expression data from members of a set of recombinant inbred lines and genotype information for the same lines. It searches for an association between each expression trait and all genotypes and evaluates that association by a permutation test. For the permutation test, it performs only as many permutations as are necessary to define the empirical P-value to a reasonable precision. It also performs bootstrap resampling to estimate the confidence region for the location of a putative QTL.

* <a href="http://ibi.zju.edu.cn/software/qtlnetwork/" target="_blank">**QTLNetwork 2.0**</a> is a software package ofr mapping QTLs with epistatic and GXE interaction effects in experimental populations including double-haploid, recombinant inbred, backcross, F2, IF2 and BxFy populations. The program provides graphical presentations of QTL mapping results. The software is programmed by C++ programming language under Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 environment. It works with Microsoft Windows operating systems, including Windows 95/98, NT, 2000, XP, 2003server. A new version of QTLNetwork is under developing, and its functions will be extended to include linkage group construction and marker-assisted virtual breeding.
