<p>Plant maintenance, tissue collection, RNA isolation, and data submission to ArrayExpress was done at SCRI by Arnis Druka with support from BBSRC/SEERAD grant SCR/910/04 The genetics of gene expression in barley&#39; to Michael Kearsey (University of Birmingham, UK) and Robbie Waugh (SCRI, UK). Probe synthesis, labeling and hybridization were performed according to manufacturer&rsquo;s protocols (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) at the Iowa State University GeneChip Core facility (Rico Caldo and Roger Wise). ArrayExpress (EBI, UK) team members Tim Rayner, Helen Parkinson, and Alvis Brazma are acknowledged for excellent help with data submission to ArrayExpress.</p>
