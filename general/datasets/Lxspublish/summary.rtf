<p>The set of 77 LXS recombinant inbred strains were generated at the Institute for Behavioral Genetics (University of Colorado, Boulder) by Beth Bennett, John DeFries, Tom Johnson, and colleages. Strains first became available for phenotyping in 2003. The large size of this panel ensures good power in genetic studies of a wide variety of complex traits.</p>
