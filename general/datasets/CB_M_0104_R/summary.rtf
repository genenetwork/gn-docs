<p>This October 2003 freeze provides estimates of mRNA expression in cerebellum of 26 adult BXD recombinant inbred strains, as well as C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, and their F1 hybrid, measured using the Affymetrix M430A and B microarrays. Data were generated by a small consortium of investigators at St. Jude Children&#39;s Research Hospital (SJ) and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UT). Data were processed using the Microarray Suite 5 (&lt;a data-cke-saved-href=&quot;http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/whitepapers/sadd_whitepaper.pdf&quot; href=&quot;http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/whitepapers/sadd_whitepaper.pdf&quot; _blank&quot;=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;fs14&quot;&gt;MAS 5) protocol of Affymetrix. To simplify comparison between transforms, MAS 5 values of each array were adjusted to an average of 8 units and a variance of 2 units. This data set was run in two large batches with careful consideration to balancing samples by sex and age. Eighteen strains have been profiled using two or three independent samples. All other strains were sampled once.</p>
