<p>This June 2005 data set provides estimates of mRNA expression in normal peritoneal fat of 32 strains of rats. The set includes the hypertensive SHR strain, the normotensive BN strain, and 30 HXB/BXH recombinant inbred strains. Each strain was sampled in quadruplicate (6-week-old males). Animals and tissues were generated by Michal Pravenec and colleagues at the Czech Academy of Sciences (CAS). RNA samples were processed at the Max-Delbr&uuml;ck-Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC), Berlin-Buch, by Norbert Hubner and colleagues. Transcriptome mapping was carried out by Norbert Hubner, Timothy Aitman and colleagues at the MDC and the MRC Clinicial Sciences Centre, Imperial College London (ICL). Samples were hybridized individually to a total of 130 Affymetrix RAE230A array. This particular data set includes 124 arrays processed using the RMA protocol. RMA values of each array were adjusted to an average of 8 units and a standard deviation of 2 units (2ZPlus8). This data set complements the MAS5 data set exploited by Hubner and colleagues <a class="fs14" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15711544" target="_blank">2005</a>. <a class="fs14" href="./array_data/Rat_230A_Fat/Transform/FT_2A_0605_Rz.xls"> Download</a> the particular transform in an Excel work book with both strain means and SEMs.</p>
