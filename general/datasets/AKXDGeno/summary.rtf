<p><a class="fs14" href="http://www.genenetwork.org/genotypes/AKXD.geno">Download</a> the entire AKXD genotype file used in GeneNetwork (n = 1352 markers with useful strain distribution pattens from a total of 5448 informative markers). We have modified the orginal <a class="fs14" href="http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/mouse/INBREDS/">Wellcome-CTC</a> genotypes by adding selected microsatellite markers. We have also curate the data and have removed somewhat improbable double-recombinant haplotypes and by imputing genotypes for a few untyped strains using very tightly linked markers. This genotype &quot;smoothing&quot; may remove some genuine recombinations and may result in linkage maps that will be very slightly conservative.</p>
