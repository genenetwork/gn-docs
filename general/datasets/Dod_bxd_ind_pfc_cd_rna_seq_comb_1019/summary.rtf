<p>The study consisted of treating BXD male and female mice to 20mg% corticosterone in the drinking water for 7 days. On the 8th day they were injected i.p. with 4mg/kg diisopropylflurophosphate, an irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor. Six hours after injection the prefrontal cortex was harvested to analyze gene expression for Il1b, Tnfa, Il6 by rtPCR.</p>

<p>D=diisopropylflurophosphate treatment</p>

<p>CD= corticosterone + diisopropylflurophosphate treatment.</p>

<p>Data are log2 gene expression for D or CD vs saline control</p>
