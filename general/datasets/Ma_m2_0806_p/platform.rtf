<p><strong>Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array: </strong>The <a class="fs14" href="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=moe430-20" target="_blank">430v2</a> array consists of 992936 useful 25-nucleotide probes that estimate the expression of approximately 39,000 transcripts and the majority of known genes and expressed sequence tags. The array sequences were selected late in 2002 using Unigene Build 107 by Affymetrix. The UTHSC group has recently reannotated all probe sets on this array, producing more accurate data on probe and probe set targets. All probes were aligned to the most recent assembly of the Mouse Genome (Build 34, mm6) using Jim Kent&#39;s BLAT program. Many of the probe sets have been manually curated by Jing Gu and Rob Williams.</p>
