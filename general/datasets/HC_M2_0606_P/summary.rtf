<p>MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DATA SET (<a href="http://frontiersin.org/neurogenomics/paper/pending/0/815/">Overall et al., 2009</a>): The Hippocampus Consortium data set provides estimates of mRNA expression in the adult hippocampus of 99 genetically diverse strains of mice including 67 BXD recombinant inbred strains, 13 CXB recombinant inbred strains, a diverse set of common inbred strains, and two reciprocal F1 hybrids.</p>

<p>The hippocampus is an important and intriguing part of the forebrain that is crucial in memory formation and retrieval, and that is often affected in epilepsy, Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and schizophrenia. Unlike most other parts of the brain, the hippocampus contains a remarkable population of stems cells that continue to generate neurons and glial cells even in adult mammals (Kempermann, <a class="normalsize" href="http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Medicine/Neurology/~~/c2Y9Y29taW5nc29vbiZzcz1wdWJkYXRlLmFzYyZzZD1hc2MmcGY9MTAmdmlldz11c2EmcHI9MTAmYm9va0NvdmVycz15ZXMmY2k9MDE5NTE3OTcxNA==" target="_empty">2005</a>). This genetic analysis of transcript expression in the hippocampus (dentate gyrus, CA1-CA3) is a joint effort of 14 investigators that is supported by numerous agencies described in the acknowledgments section.</p>
