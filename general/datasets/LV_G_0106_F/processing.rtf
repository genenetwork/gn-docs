<p>We used a mix of C57BL/6J RNA as the reference (liver, kidney, lung, brain and spleen). Each measurement is the ratio of sample intensity over the reference intensity. The data was normalized using a robust LOWESS smoothing method that adjusts for non-linearity between the two color channels (see Yang Yee Hwa et. al., Normalization for cDNA microarray data: a robust composite method addressing single and multiple slide systematic variation, Nucl. Acid Res., 2002). We then took the log2 of these ratios. A value of 1 indicates that the expression of that gene in the sample is twice that of the reference. Since the reference, includes liver, the range of values is more modest than some other scales of gene expression. (From Dan Gatti, Sept 2012).</p>
