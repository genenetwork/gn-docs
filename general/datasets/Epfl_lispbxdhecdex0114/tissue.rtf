<p>Hearts were later shattered in liquid nitrogen, usually broken into 2-4 pieces, and around half of the sample (at random) was taken for preparation. All ~5 animals per cohort had their RNA prepared, and then were pooled evenly (by &micro;g of RNA) into a single RNA sample for each cohort, thus differences due to different segments of the heart being taken should be mitigated, although not eliminated, and researchers examining extremely specific transcriptional regulation in the heart should keep this in mind. The pooled RNA samples were then purified using RNEasy, then sent out for array analysis. All RIN values were &gt; 8.0.</p>
