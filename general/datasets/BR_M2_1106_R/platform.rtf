<p><strong>Affymetrix MOE430v2 GeneChip:</strong> The expression data were generated using 248 MOE430v2 arrays. The chromosomal locations of MOE430v2 probe sets were determined by BLAT analysis of concatenated probe sequences using the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium Mar 2005 (mm6). This BLAT analysis is performed periodically by Yanhua Qu as each new build of the mouse genome is released (see http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat?command=start&amp;org=mouse). We thank Yan Cui (UTHSC) for allowing us to use his Linux cluster to perform this analysis. It is possible to confirm the BLAT alignment results yourself simply by clicking on the Verify link in the Trait Data and Editing Form (right side of the Location line).</p>
