<p>This is a microRNA data set generated using the&nbsp;Affymetrix Genechip miRNA 4.0 array&nbsp;(see&nbsp;http://media.affymetrix.com/support/technical/datasheets/miRNA_4-0_and_4-1_datasheet.pdf).</p>

<p>The data set provides 3222 estimates of expression (mainly for mi-RNAs) for 45 retinas from C57BL/6J (B6 cases B6.01 to B6.17), DBA/2J (cases D2.01 to D2.16), and DBA/2J with a wildtype Gpnmb allele (D2GP.01 to D2GP.12). Cases range in age from 30 to 576 days and include both sexes.</p>

<p>We are using this data set in combination with the conventional Mouse Gene 1.0ST array to study normal and glaucomatous changes in gene expression as a function of age.&nbsp;</p>
