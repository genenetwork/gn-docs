<p>Data entered by Arthur Centeno and Manju Jagalur, Feb 27, 2009. This data set modified data for two BXD strains. Data were added for BXD79 that had been incorrectly included as a striatum sample (this data set was therefore deleted from the Exon 1.0ST striatum data set). We also changed data for BXD39. As expected, this addition and correction improved QTL mapping values. For example, for Kcnj9 probe set 4519178 the LRS values increased from 103.3 in the Aug08 data to 115.7 for these Feb09 data. Rob is concerned about the high error term of BXD39.</p>
