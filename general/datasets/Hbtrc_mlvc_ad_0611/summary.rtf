<p>This study aims at identifying functional variation in the human genome (especially as it pertains to brain expressed RNAs) and elucidate its relationship to disease and drug response. The ~800 individuals in this dataset are composed of approximately 400 Alzheimers disease (AD) cases, 230 Huntington&#39;s Disease (HD) and 170 controls (N) matched for age, gender, and post mortem interval (PMI). The tissue specimens for this study were provided by Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center (HBTRC). Three brain regions (cerebellum, visual cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) from the same individuals were profiled on a custom-made Agilent 44K microarray of 39,280 DNA probes uniquely targeting 37,585 known and predicted genes, including splice variants, miRNAs and high-confidence non-coding RNA sequences. The individuals were genotyped on two different platforms, the Illumina HumanHap650Y array and a custom Perlegen 300K array (a focused panel for detection of singleton SNPs). Clinical outcomes available include age at onset, age at death, Braak scores (AD), Vonsattel scores (HD), Regional brain enlargement/atrophy.</p>
