<blockquote>We have used a set of 14 conventional inbred strains, reciprocal F1s between C57BL/6J (B6 or B) and DBA/2J D2 (or D), and 47 BXD recombinant inbred strains. The BXD strains were generated by crossing C57BL/6J with DBA/2J. The BXDs are particularly useful for systems genetics because both parental strains have been sequenced (8x coverage of B6 and 1.5x coverage of D). Physical maps in WebQTL incorporate approximately 2 million B vs D SNPs from <a class="fs14" href="http://www.celeradiscoverysystem.com/index.cfm" target="_blank">Celera Genomics</a> and from the Perlegen-NIEHS sequencing effort. BXD1 through BXD32 were bred by Benjamin A. Taylor starting in the late 1970s. BXD33 through 42 were bred by Taylor in the 1990s. These strains are available from The Jackson Laboratory.

<p>Please note that BXD24/TyJ (JAX stock number 000031) used in this study is also known as BXD24b/TyJ and has complete retinal degeneration. BXD24a/TyJ, a 1988 F80 stock that has now been rederived, does not have retinal degeneration (stock number 005243) and is an ideal coisogenic control.</p>

<p>BXD43 through BXD99 were bred by Lu Lu, Jeremy Peirce, Lee M. Silver, and Robert W. Williams in the late 1990s and early 2000s using advanced intercross progeny (Peirce et al. <a class="fs14" href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/5/7" target="_blank">2004</a>). Many of the 50 new BXD strains are available from <a class="fs14" href="mailto:lulu@nb.utmem.EDU" target="_blank">Lu Lu</a> and colleagues.</p>

<p><strong>Mouse Diversity Panel (MDP)</strong>. In addition to the BXD strains, we have profiled a MDP consisting 14 inbred strains and a pair of reciprocal F1 hybrids; B6D2F1 and D2B6F1. These strains were selected for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>genetic and phenotypic diversity, including use by the <a class="fs14" href="http://aretha.jax.org/pub-cgi/phenome/mpdcgi?rtn=strains%2Flist&amp;listmode=pri&amp;typemode=all&amp;genaltmode=no&amp;submit1=%A0%A0Go%A0%A0" target="_empty">Phenome Project</a></li>
	<li>their use in making genetic reference populations including recombinant inbred strains, cosomic strains, congenic and recombinant congenic strains</li>
	<li>their use by the <a class="fs14" href="http://www.complextrait.org" target="_empty">Complex Trait Consortium</a> to make the Collaborative Cross (Nairobi/Wellcome, Oak Ridge/DOE, and Perth/UWA)</li>
	<li>genome sequence data from three sources (NHGRI, Celera, and Perlegen-NIEHS)</li>
	<li>availability from The Jackson Laboratory</li>
</ul>

<p>All eight parents of the Collaborative Cross (129, A, C57BL/6J, CAST, NOD, NZO, PWK, and WSB) have been included in the MDP (noted below in the list). Twelve MDP strains have been sequenced, or are currently being resequenced by Perlegen for the NIEHS. This panel will be extremely helpful in systems genetic analysis of a wide variety of traits, and will be a powerful adjunct in fine mapping modulators using what is essentially an association analysis of sequence variants.</p>
