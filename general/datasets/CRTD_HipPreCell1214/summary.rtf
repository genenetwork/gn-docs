<p>This data set was generated from proliferating adherent cultures of adult hippocampus-derived precursor cells from 20 BXD strains. The dentate gyrus of the mouse hippocampus is the site of continued neural precursor proliferation and generation of new neurons in adulthood as a distinct process from the widespread embryonic and juvenile neurogenesis during development. Adult-derived precursors can be isolated and maintained in adherent culture (Babu et al., 2007, 2011) and can be differentiated into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. In this study, cultures were established from 20 BXD strains obtained through the authors&rsquo; involvement in the GeNeSys Consortium. This data set was obtained from cultures actively proliferating in the presence of growth factors.</p>
