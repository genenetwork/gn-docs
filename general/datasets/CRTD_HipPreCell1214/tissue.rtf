<p>The mice used in this study were bred at Harlan () for the GeNeSys Consortium and were delivered to the study site in Dresden at c. 6 weeks of age. Some animals were the 1st generation offspring of the Harlan stock which were bred and raised locally at the CRTD (housed at the Medizinisch-Theoretisches Zentrum of the Technische Universit&auml;t Dresden). Animals were killed the day after delivery (or at 6 weeks of age if locally bred) and the hippocampi dissected and processed for precursor cell culture (Babu et al., 2011). Proliferating cultures were maintained in the presence of EGF and FGF-2 and passaged every 3-4 days. For microarray analysis, c. 1 million cells were harvested by on-plate lysis and total RNA prepared using the RNEasy mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer&rsquo;s protocol (including optional on-column DNase treatment). Each strain was assayed in triplicate (from 3 different passages).</p>
