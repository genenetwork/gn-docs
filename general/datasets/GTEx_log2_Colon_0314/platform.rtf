<p>Expression</p>

<p>RPKM data are used as produced by <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/rna-seqc" target="_blank">RNA-SeQC</a>. Filter on &gt;=10 individuals having &gt;0.1RPKM. Log and quantile normalize the expression values across all samples. Outlier correction: for each gene, rank values across samples then map to a standard normal.</p>
