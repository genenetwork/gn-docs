<p>GeneNetwork displays only the strain averages &plusmn; SEM for each metabolite. To obtain the individual data for each animal, please use the link above under (<strong>Download datasets and supplementary data files)</strong>. Note that this contains two entries for each animal: these are technical replicates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;raw spectral data from the mass spectrometer can be downloaded on MassIVE (&nbsp;<a href="http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/massive.jsp?redirect=auth" target="_blank">http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/massive.jsp?redirect=auth</a>&nbsp;)&nbsp;under the identifier MSV000079411. This spectral data is for all 290 individual animals, and it includes two technical replicates for each individual, for a total of 580 runs. The file size is 102 GB and we do not recommend downloading this unless you are specifically interested in re-analyzing the spectra from scratch and looking into the granular details of mass spectrometry metabolomics.</p>
