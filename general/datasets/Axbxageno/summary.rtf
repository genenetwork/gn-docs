<p><a href="http://datafiles.genenetwork.org/download/GN636/AXBXA.geno">Download</a> the entire AXB/BXA genotype file used in GeneNetwork (n = 2446 unique strain distribution patterns based on a total of 8514 informative markers). We have modified the orginal <a href="http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/mouse/INBREDS/">Wellcome-CTC</a> genotypes by adding selected microsatellite markers. We have also curate the data and have removed somewhat improbable double-recombinant haplotypes and by imputing genotypes for a few untyped strains using very tightly linked markers. This genotype &quot;smoothing&quot; may remove some genuine recombinations and may result in linkage maps that will be very slightly conservative.</p>
