<p>Expression profiling by array.</p>

<p>One group of mice was fed an atherogenic high-fat (30% fat) diet containing cholic acid to increase fat uptake and another was fed a low-fat (6% fat) regular chow diet. Males and females from both diets were studied for mouse strains 129S1/SvImJ, A/J, BALB/cJ, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, CAST/EiJ, DBA/2J, I/LnJ, MRL/MpJ-Tnfrsf6lpr/J, NZB/BINJ, PERA/Ei, and SM/J. All strains were sacrificed between 11- and 13 weeks of age except for CAST and PERA, which were harvested after 50 weeks of age. CAST and PERA were subsequently removed from our analysis based on discrepant harvest age, but can be found in our database (see below). Three replicate animals were used for each combination of diet, strain, and sex, resulting in a total of 120 mice surveyed for gene expression.</p>
