<p>This BXD data set provides estimates of mRNA expression in the prefrontal cortex following ethanol treatment across 27 BXD recombinant inbred strains and their B6 and D2 progenitor strains. All samples are from a total of 468 adult male animals obtained from Jackson Laboratory and raised in a standard laboratory environment. An average of 8 males per strain was used to measure anxiety-like behavior in response to restraint and treatment with 1.8g/kg ethanol in the light-dark transition model of anxiety. Four hours after treatment, animals were rapidly sacrificed by cervical dislocation, brains were removed, cooled and microdissected as previously described (Kerns et al., J. Neurosci. 25:2255, 2005). All RNA isolation and subsequent probe generation and hybridization to microarrays were completed using a supervised randomization procedure to minimize batch effects. Affymetrix M430 type 2.0 microarrays were used for hybridization using standard procedures. Expression analysis was conducted by estimating the relative abundance of over 45,000 transcripts in the prefrontal cortex following ethanol treatment using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) method.</p>
