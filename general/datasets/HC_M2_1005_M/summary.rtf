<blockquote>PRELIMINARY: The October 2005 Hippocampus Consortium data set provides estimates of mRNA expression in the adult hippocampus of approximately 99 genetically diverse strains of mice including 68 BXD recombinant inbred strains, 13 CXB recombinant inbred strains, a set of 16 diverse inbred strains, and 2 reciprocal F1 hybrids. The hippocampus is an important and intriguing part of the forebrain that is crucial for memory formation, and that is often affected in epilepsy, Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and schizophrenia. Unlike most other parts of the brain, the hippocampus contains a remarkable population of stems cells that continue to generate neurons and glial cells even in adult mammals (Kempermann, <a class="fs14" href="http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Medicine/Neurology/~~/c2Y9Y29taW5nc29vbiZzcz1wdWJkYXRlLmFzYyZzZD1hc2MmcGY9MTAmdmlldz11c2EmcHI9MTAmYm9va0NvdmVycz15ZXMmY2k9MDE5NTE3OTcxNA==" target="_empty">2005</a>). This genetic analysis of transcript expression in the hippocampus (dentate gyrus, CA1-CA3, and parts of the subiculum) is a joint effort of 14 investigators that is supported by numerous agencies described in the acknowledgments section. Samples were processed using a total of 206 Affymetrix Mouse Expression 430 2.0 short oligomer microarrays (MOE430 2.0 or M430v2), of which 179 passed stringent quality control and error checking. This particular data set was processed using the <a class="fs14" href="http://www.affymetrix.com/products/software/specific/gcos.affx" target="_blank">MAS5</a> protocol. To simplify comparisons among transforms, MAS5 values of each array were adjusted to an average of 8 units and a standard deviation of 2 units.</blockquote>
