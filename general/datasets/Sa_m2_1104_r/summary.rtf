<blockquote>This November 2004 data freeze provides estimates of mRNA expression in the <a class="normal" href="http://www.nervenet.org/NetPapers/Rosen/Striatum2001/StriatumMain.html" target="_blank">striatum</a> (caudate nucleus of the forebrain) of BXD recombinant inbred mice measured using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 short oligomer microarrays. Data were generated at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC, Boston MA) by Glenn D. Rosen with the support of a Human Brain Project (HBP) grant. Approximately 125 brain samples from 24 strains were used in this initial experiment. Data were processed using the Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5 (MAS 5) transform. To simplify comparison among Nov04 data sets, values of each array have been log2 transformed and adjusted to an average expression of 8 units.</blockquote>
