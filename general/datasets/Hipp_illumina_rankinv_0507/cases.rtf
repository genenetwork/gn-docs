<p>The <a class="fs14" href="http://www.genenetwork.org/mouseCross.html#LXS" target="_empty">LXS</a> genetic reference panel of recombinant inbred strains consists of just over 77 strains. All of these strains have been inbred for more than 23 generations (F23). All strains have been genotyped at 13,377 SNPs. Thanks to the efforts of <a class="fs14" href="http://www.gnf.org/technology/organismal/mamm-genetics-haplotype-mutation-mapping.htm" target="_empty">Dr. Timothy Wiltshire</a> at the Genome Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation, the two parental strains have been genotyped at 156,551 SNPs. These genotypes are incorporated in the GeneNetwork <a class="fs14" href="http://www.genenetwork.org/webqtl/snpBrowser.py" target="_empty">SNP Browser</a>.</p>

<p>Strains are currently available from Drs. Beth Bennett and Tom Johnson at the <a class="fs14" href="http://ibgwww.colorado.edu/" target="_empty">Institute of Behavioral Genetics</a> (IBG) in Boulder Colorado.</p>
