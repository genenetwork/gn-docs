<p>Hypothalamus was dissected from adult male and female mice and process for expression analysis.</p>

<p>RNA isolation<br />
Total RNA was purified using the RNAeasy micro kit on the QIAcube system (www.qiagen.com). RNA purity and concentration was checked using 260/280 nm absorbance ratio and RNA integrity was analyzed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies).</p>

<p>This preliminary data set is associated with 430 eQTLs with LOD scores above 10. Peak LRS is 146 for Trait ID 10513604 (<em>Hdhd3</em>).</p>
