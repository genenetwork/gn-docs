<p>CAUTION: DO NOT USE THE PDNN TRANSFORM of the HEIMED EYE Database. USE RMA INSTEAD. This April 2005 data freeze provides estimates of mRNA expression in adult eye from 50 lines of mice including C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, their F1 hybrids, and 47 BXD recombinant inbred strains. Data were generated at UTHSC. Samples were hybridized in small pools (<em>n</em> = 3) to Affymetrix M430 2.0 arrays. This particular data set was processed using the <a class="fs14" href="http://odin.mdacc.tmc.edu/~zhangli/PerfectMatch/" target="_blank">PDNN</a> method of Zhang. To simplify comparison among transforms, PDNN values of each array were adjusted to an average of 8 units and a standard deviation of 2 units.</p>
