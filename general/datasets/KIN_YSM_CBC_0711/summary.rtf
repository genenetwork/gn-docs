<p>Our understanding of the evolution, formation, and pathological disruption of human brain circuits is impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on the developing brain transcriptome. Thus, we have undertaken whole-genome, exon-level expression analysis of thirteen regions from left and right sides of the mid-fetal human brain, finding 76% of genes to be expressed, and 44% of these to be differentially regulated. These data reveal a large number of specific gene expression and alternative splicing patterns, as well as co-expression networks, associated with distinct regions and neurodevelopmental processes. Of particular relevance to cognitive specializations, we have characterized the transcriptional landscapes of prefrontal cortex and perisylvian speech and language areas, which exhibit a population-level global expression symmetry. Finally, we show that differentially expressed genes are more frequently associated with human-specific evolution of putative cis-regulatory elements. Altogether, these data provide a wealth of novel biological insights into the complex transcriptional and molecular underpinnings of human brain development and evolution.</p>
