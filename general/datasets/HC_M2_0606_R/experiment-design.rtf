<p>Pooled RNA samples (usually one pool of male hippocampii and one pool of female hippocampii) were prepared using standard protocols. Samples were processed using a total of 206 Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Expression 430 2.0 short oligomer arrays (MOE430 2.0 or M430v2; see GEO platform ID <a class="normalsize" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GPL1261" target="_empty">GPL1261</a>), of which 201 passed quality control and error checking. This particular data set was processed using the <a class="normalsize" href="http://odin.mdacc.tmc.edu/~zhangli/PerfectMatch/" target="_blank">PDNN</a> protocol. To simplify comparisons among transforms, PDNN values of each array were adjusted to an average of 8 units and a standard deviation of 2 units.</p>
