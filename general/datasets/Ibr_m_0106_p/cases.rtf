<blockquote>We have used a set of BXD recombinant inbred strains generated by crossing C57BL/6J (B6 or B) with DBA/2J (D2 or D). The BXDs are particularly useful for systems genetics because both parental strains have been sequenced (8x coverage of B6 and 1.5x coverage for D). Physical maps in WebQTL incorporate approximately 1.75 million B vs D SNPs from <a class="fs14" href="http://www.celeradiscoverysystem.com/index.cfm" target="_blank">Celera</a>. BXD2 through BXD32 were bred by Benjamin A. Taylor starting in the late 1970s. BXD33 through 42 were bred by Taylor in the 1990s. These strains are available from The Jackson Laboratory. BXD43 through BXD99 were bred by Lu Lu, Jeremy Peirce, Lee M. Silver, and Robert W. Williams in the late 1990s and early 2000s using advanced intercross progeny (Peirce et al. <a class="fs14" href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/5/7" target="_blank">2004</a>). Many of the 50 new BXD strains are available from <a class="fs14" href="mailto:lulu@nb.utmem.EDU" target="_blank">Lu Lu</a> and colleagues

<p>All stock was obtained originally from The Jackson Laboratory between 1999 and 2003. Most BXD animals were born and housed at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Some cases were bred at the University of Memphis (Douglas Matthews) or the University of Alabama (John Mountz and Hui-Chen Hsu).</p>
