<blockquote><strong>Probe (cell) level data from the CEL file: </strong>These CEL values produced by <a class="fs14" href="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/product_updates/gcos_download.affx" target="_blank">GCOS</a> are 75% quantiles from a set of pixel measured in each cell.

<p><strong>Probe set data: </strong>The original CEL values were processed using RMA and log2 transformed using our standard 2z +8 transform. This recenters each array to a mean of 8 units and a SD of 2 units. Probe set values are typically the averages of four biological replicates within strain.</p>
