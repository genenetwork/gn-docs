<p>Identify genes in the liver whose expression is under genetic regulation in the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP). The HMDP comprises classical inbred and recombinant inbred wild type mice. 104 of these strains were bred onto a C57BL/6J background carrying transgenes for both ApoE-Leiden and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). The RMA values of genes were used for genome wide association as described in Davis et al PLOS Genetics 2015. These data are used to identify candidate genes at loci associated with atherosclerotic lesion size.</p>
