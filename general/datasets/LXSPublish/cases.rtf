<p>The parental strains of the LXS set are Inbred Long-Sleep (ILS) and Inbred Short-Sleep (ISS) strains. These parental strains have been phenotyped intensively by behavioral geneticists and neuropharmacologists for a decade (e.g., Markel PD et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=7755520" target="_blank">1995</a>, Hanania and Zahniser <a class="fs14" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15476748" target="_blank">2004</a>. The LXS strains have an intriguing history and trace back to an 8-way cross initiated in the 1950s by Gerald McClearn, the dean of mouse behavior genetics.</p>

<p>The LXS panel has recently been genotyped at 330 microsatellite markers, and this panel can already be used to map Mendelian and quantitative trait loci. As an example, the current prototype LXS phenotype database contains information on coat color treated as an ordinal trait (1 = albino, 5 = black). This simple trait produces a QTL with an LRS score of 73 (LOD score of ~16) on Chr 7 with a peak within a few megabases of the tyrosinase gene.</p>
