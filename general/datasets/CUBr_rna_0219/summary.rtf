<p>We conducted a high-throughput sequencing study to measure whole brain miRNA expression levels in alcohol na&iuml;ve animals in the LXS panel of recombinant inbred (RI) mouse strains. We then combined the sequencing data with genotype data, microarray gene expression data, and data on alcohol-related behavioral phenotypes such as &#39;Drinking in the dark&#39;, &#39;Sleep time&#39;, and &#39;Low dose activation&#39; from the same RI panel.</p>
