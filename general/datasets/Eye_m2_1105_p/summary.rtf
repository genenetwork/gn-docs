<p>SUPERCEDED EYE DATASET. The HEIMED November 2005 data set provides estimates of mRNA expression in whole eyes of 63 lines of mice without significant biological replication. Data were generated at UTHSC with support from a grant from Dr. Barrett Haik, Director of the Hamilton Eye Institute (<a class="fs14" href="http://www.eye.utmem.edu/cvr/hei.html" target="_blank">HEI</a>). Pooled RNA samples were hybridized to Affymetrix M430 2.0 arrays. This particular data set was processed using the <a class="normal" href="http://stat-www.berkeley.edu/users/bolstad/RMAExpress/RMAExpress.html" target="_blank">RMA</a> protocol. To simplify comparison among different transforms, RMA values of each array have been adjusted to an average expression of 8 units and a standard deviation of 2 units.</p>
