<p>FPKM data were quantitle normalized for each ENSEMBL gene (mRNA)&nbsp;model (Identifiers such as ENSMUSG00000093778). Every gene/mRNA therefore has a mean expression value of 0 and a perfectly normal distribution, even if the original distribution was bimodal. The QQ plots is GN will be straight lines. There is no data at all on expression level in this original data set downloaded from <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2rs41">http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2rs41</a></p>
