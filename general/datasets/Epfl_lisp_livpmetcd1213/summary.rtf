<p>We identified 979 unique metabolite features based on mass-charge ratios (m/z) using flow-injection ToF-MS, respectively. Of these features, 699 could be attributed to a single metabolite, including in cases where of the two &ldquo;possible&rdquo; enantiomers, one is clearly far more predominant than the other (e.g. L versus D amino acids). The remaining 280 metabolites were &ldquo;clusters&rdquo; with no clear predominant feature&mdash;for example, the &ldquo;glucose&rdquo; metabolite measurements could not be separated from fructose, galactose, or mannose measurements, as all share the same m/z. The &ldquo;main&rdquo; metabolite, as well as all possible alternatives are listed with the data on&nbsp;<a href="http://genenetwork.org/" target="_blank">GeneNetwork.org</a>&nbsp;for the raw file download (press the &ldquo;INFO&rdquo; button next to the dataset on the main search page and download the dataset and supplemental data files).</p>
