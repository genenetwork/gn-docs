<p>Brain proteome data. Deep proteome data were generated using whole brain tissue from both parents and 29 members of the HXB family, one male and one female per strain. Proteins in these samples were identified and quantified using the tandem-mass-tag (TMT) labeling strategy coupled with two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/LC-MS/MS).</p>

<p>This rat whole brain proteome data provide protein expression of 31 HXB/BXH strains, including 29 RI strains, and two parental strains, SHR/OlaIpcv and BN-Lx/Cub. A total of 8,124 proteins were quantified across all 31 strains.</p>
