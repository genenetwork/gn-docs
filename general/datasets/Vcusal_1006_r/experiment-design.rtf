<p>This data set was generated concurrently with the VCU saline prefrontal cortex BXD RMA data and therefore consisted of 64 microarrays processed in 5 groups of 8 to 16 microarrays during the month of September 2006. All RNA extractions, cRNA synthesis, and hybridizations were randomized across strain and treatment groups to minimize batch effects.</p>

<p>Many of the techniques used to generate this data set are described in a recent publication in the <a class="fs14" href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/25/9/2255" target="_empty">Journal of Neuroscience</a>.</p>

<p>Animals were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with saline or 1.8 g/kg of ethanol. As part of a parallel study of ethanol induced anxiolysis, all mice underwent behavioral testing that included 15 minutes of restraint in a 50 mL conical tube followed by 10 minutes in a light-dark chamber. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation four hours following IP injection. Immediately thereafter, brains were extracted and chilled for 1 minute in iced phosphate buffer before being microdissected into 8 constituent regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex. Samples were randomly assigned to batch groups prior to total RNA extraction, cRNA synthesis and hybridization. Each microarray represent a pooling of 4-5 animals.</p>
