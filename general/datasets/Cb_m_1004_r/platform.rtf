<blockquote><strong>Affymetrix Mouse Expression <a class="fs14" href="http://www.affymetrix.com/products/arrays/specific/mouse430.affx" target="_blank"> 430</a> GeneChip set:</strong> The expression data were generated using 430A and 430B arrays. Chromosomal positions of probe sets were determined by BLAT analysis of concatenated probe sequences using the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium May 2004 (mm5) assembly. This BLAT analysis is performed periodically by Yanhua Qu as each new build of the mouse genome is released (see <a class="fs14" href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat?command=start&amp;org=mouse">http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat?command=start&amp;org=mouse</a>). We thank Yan Cui (UTHSC) for allowing us to use his Linux cluster to perform this analysis. It is possiible to confirm the BLAT alignment results yourself simply by clicking on the <strong>Verify</strong> link in the Trait Data and Editing Form (right side of the <strong>Location</strong> line).
