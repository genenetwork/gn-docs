<p>Each array was hybridized with labeled cRNA generated from a pool of three brains from adult animals usually of the same age and always of the same sex. The brain region included most of the forebrain and midbrain, bilaterally. However, the sample excluded the olfactory bulbs, retinas, or the posterior pituitary (all formally part of the forebrain). A total of 100 such pooled samples were arrayed: 74 from females and 26 from males. Animals ranged in age from 56 to 441 days, usually with a balanced design: one pool at approximately 8 weeks, one pool at approximately 20 weeks, and one pool at approximately 1 year. Strain averages of mRNA expression level are therefore typically based on three pooled biological replicate arrays. This data set does not incorporate statistical adjustment for possible effects of age and sex. Users can select the strain symbol in the table above to review details about the specific cases and array processing center (DP = Divyen Patel at Genome Explorations, Inc; TS = Thomas Sutter at University of Memphis).
