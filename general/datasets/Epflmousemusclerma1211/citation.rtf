<blockquote type="cite">Citation: The chow diet data were first published in the paper &quot;Pharmacological Inhibition of Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerases Improves Fitness and Mitochondrial Function in Skeletal Muscle&quot; in June 2014. The complete dataset was published in the paper&nbsp;&quot;An evolutionarily conserved role for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the regulation of movement&quot; in September 2014. If you are using exclusively the chow diet data, please cite the former paper, but if you are using both diets, or if you are only using high fat data, please cite just the latter paper. The complete phenotyping data for these individuals was published in 2016 in the paper &quot;Systems proteomics of liver mitochondria function&quot;. Note that the animals used in that 2016 paper are exactly the same ones as the September 2014 paper. Note that in addition to quadriceps transcriptome data on these individuals, liver mRNA, liver SRM proteomics (200 proteins), liver SWATH proteomics (2600 proteins), liver metabolomics, plasma metabolomics (under &quot;Phenotypes&quot; in GeneNetwork), brown adipose mRNA (CD only), and heart mRNA are all published and openly available here in GeneNetwork. Liver and plasma lipidomics, gastrointestinal mRNA and white adipose tissue mRNA have also been completed and are expected to be published in the future but remain under active work (January 2018 note).</blockquote>
