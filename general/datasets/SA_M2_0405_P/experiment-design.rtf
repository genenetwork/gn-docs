<blockquote>RNA was extracted by Rosen and colleagues and was then processed by the <a class="fs14" href="https://www.bidmcgenomics.org/" target="_blank">BIDMC Genomics Core</a>. Labeled cRNA was generated using the Amersham Biosciences cRNA synthesis kit protocol.
<p><strong>Replication and Sample Balance:</strong> Our goal is to obtain data for independent biological sample pools from at least one sample from each sex for all BXD strains. We have not yet achieved this goal. Twenty-three of 33 strains are represented by male and female samples. The remaining 8 strains are still represented by single sex samples: BXD11 (F), BXD13 (F), BXD19 (F), BXD20 (F), BXD22 (M), BXD23 (M), BXD24 (M), BXD32 (M), C57BL/6J (M), and DBA/2J (M).</p>

<p><strong>Batch Structure:</strong> This data set consists of arrays processed in three batches with several reruns for the first batch. All arrays were processed using a single protocol. All data have been corrected for batch effects as described below.</p>
