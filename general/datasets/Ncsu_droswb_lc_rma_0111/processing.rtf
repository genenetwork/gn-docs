<p>Our measure of expression for each probe set was the median log2 signal intensity of perfect-match probes without SFPs. We used negative control probes to estimate the background intensity, and removed probes below this threshold.</p>

<p>Data may have been normalized prior to entry into GeneNetwork using 2z + 8 transform. This method simply stabilizes the variance of all array data sets, and resets the z score to 8 (rather than 0).</p>
