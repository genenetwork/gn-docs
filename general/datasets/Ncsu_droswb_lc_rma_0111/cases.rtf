<p>The raw microarray data are deposited in the ArrayExpress database (<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/browse.html?keywords=E-MEXP-1594&amp;expandefo=on">www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress,</a>) under accession number E-MEXP-1594</p>

<p>We have derived a population of 192 inbred lines by 20 generations of full sib inbreeding of isofemale lines collected from the Raleigh, NC population. A White Paper to obtain complete genome sequences of these lines (link to pdf of White Paper) has been approved by the National Institutes of Health National Human Genome Research Institute, using a combination of 454 XLR long read pyrosequencing and paired end Solexa short read (currently 45 bp) technology. The sequencing is being done at the Baylor College of Medicine Sequencing Center, in collaboration with Richard Gibbs and Stephen Richards.</p>
