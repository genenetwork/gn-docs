<p><strong>Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0: </strong>The <a class="normal" href="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=moe430-20" target="_blank">430 2.0</a> array consist of approximately 992936 25-nucleotide probes that collectively estimate the expression of approximately 39,000 transcripts. The array sequences were selected late in 2002 using Unigene Build 107. The arrays nominally contain the same probe sequences as the 430A and 430B series. However, we have found that roughy 75000 probes differ from those on A and B arrays and those on the 430 2.0</p>
