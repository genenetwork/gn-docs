<p>The BXD genetic reference population is a recombinant inbred panel descended from crosses between the C57BL/6 (B6) and DBA/2 (D2) strains of mice, which segregate for about 5 million sequence variants. Recently, some these variants have been established with effects on general metabolic phenotypes such as glucose response and bone strength. In this study, we examined both genetic variants across 40 strains of BXD and the two founder lines, in addition&nbsp;to a major environmental influence&mdash;long term feeding with chow diet (CD) or high fat diet (HFD)&mdash;to see how metabolic gene expression varies by genotype and environment, and gene-by-environment interactions. The basic heart phenotypes quantified in these cohorts were not affected by HFD feeding (e.g. blood pressure and heart rate).&nbsp;</p>
