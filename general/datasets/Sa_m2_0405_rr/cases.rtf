<p>We have used a set of BXD recombinant inbred strains generated by crossing C57BL/6J (B6 or B) with DBA/2J (D2 or D). The BXDs are particularly useful for systems genetics because both parental strains have been sequenced (8x coverage of B6 and 1.5x coverage for D). Physical maps in WebQTL incorporate approximately 1.75 million B vs D SNPs from <a class="normalsize" href="http://www.celeradiscoverysystem.com/index.cfm" target="_blank">Celera</a>. BXD2 through BXD32 were bred by Benjamin A. Taylor starting in the late 1970s. BXD33 through 42 were bred by Taylor in the 1990s. These strains are available from The Jackson Laboratory.</p>
