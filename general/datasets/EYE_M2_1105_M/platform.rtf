<p><strong>Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays: </strong>The <a class="normal" href="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=moe430-20" target="_blank">430 2.0</a> array consists of 992936 25-nucleotide probes that estimate the expression of approximately 39,000 transcripts (many are essentially duplicates). The array sequences were selected late in 2002 using Unigene Build 107. The array nominally contain the same probe sequence as the old M430A and 430B array pair. However, we have found that roughy 75000 probes differ between those on A and B arrays and those on the new 430 2.0.</p>
