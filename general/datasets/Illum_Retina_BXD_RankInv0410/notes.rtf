<p>This data set is available as a <a href="http://www.genenetwork.org/share/data/ref.php?InfoPageName=Illum_Retina_BXD_RankInv0309">bulk download in several formats</a>. The data are available as either strain means or the individual arrays. Due to the involved normalization procedures required to correct for batch effects we strongly recommend not using the raw CEL files without special statistical procedures.</p>
