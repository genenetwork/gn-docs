All probe sets represented on the GeneChip Mouse Expression Set 430 are included on the GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array. The sequences from which these probe sets were derived were selected from GenBank&laquo;, dbEST, and RefSeq. The sequence clusters were created from the UniGene database (Build 107, June 2002) and then refined by analysis and comparison with the publicly available draft assembly of the mouse genome from the Whitehead Institute for Genome Research (MGSC, April 2002).</p>
