<p>The GeneChip&reg; Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array is the latest product in the family of Affymetrix expression arrays offering whole-transcript coverage. Each of the 28,853 genes is represented on the array by approximately 27 probes spread across the full length of the gene, providing a more complete and more accurate picture of gene expression than 3&#39;-based expression array designs. The small format of the array makes it a cost-effective expression profiling solution for new microarray users. Sense DNA targets are generated from as little as 100ng of total RNA. The Gene 1.0 ST Array is part of a complete solution for gene expression analysis that includes Whole Transcript (WT) Sense Target Labeling and Control Reagents, fluidics and scanning instrumentation and basic analysis software. The array contains the most up-to-date content of well-annotated genes, and data is analyzed using a simple workflow. The Gene 1.0 ST Array uses a subset of probes from the Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array and covers only well-annotated content. Like the Exon 1.0 ST Array, &quot;gene-level&quot; analysis of multiple probes on different exons is summarized into an expression value representing all transcripts from the same gene.</p>
