<p>The BXD genetic reference panel of recombinant inbred strains consists of just over 80 strains. The BXDs in this data set include 8 of the BXD strains made by Benjamin Taylor at the Jackson Laboratory in the 1970s and 1990s (BXD1 through BXD42). All of these strains are fully inbred, many well beyond the 100th filial (F) generation of inbreeding. We have also included 10 inbred (F20+) BXD lines generated by Lu and Peirce. In addition, the parental strains C57BL/6J and DBA/2J were used to yield a total of 20 genetically unique cell lines. All of these strains have been genotyped at 13,377 SNPs.</p>
