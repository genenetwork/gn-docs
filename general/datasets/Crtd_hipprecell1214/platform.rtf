<p>Illumina MouseWG-6 array with custom probe mapping: This data set uses a custom mapping of probes to Entrez GeneIDs. Each probe sequence on the MouseWG-6 v. 2.0 array was queried against the mm9 mouse genome using Jim Kent&#39;s BLAT program. The genomic position of probes returning a single hit was then used to assign the probe to an NCBI Entrez GeneID. Probes targeting the same GeneID were collapsed as means to yield data for 21155 unique genes.</p>
