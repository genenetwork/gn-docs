<p>Liver samples were taken from 29 male and 31 females. Total RNA was isolated with RNAzol Reagent (Tel-Test, Inc.) using a modification of the single-step acid guanidinium isothiocyanate phenol-chloroform extraction method according to the manufacturer&#39;s protocol. The extracted RNA was purified using RNeasy (Qiagen, Inc.). RNA samples were evaluated by UV spectroscopy for concentration. RNA quality was monitored by visualization on an ethidium bromide-stained denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel. RNA samples were converted to cDNA, and then biotin-labeled cRNA according to Affymetrix Expression Analysis Technical Manual. The labeled samples were hybridized to the M430A, and subsequently the M430B array. The hybridization, washing and scanning steps were carried out by Hong Lan using the Affymetrix core facility at the Gene Expression Center of University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p>
