<blockquote>The F<sub>2</sub>-ob/ob mice were chosen from a mapping panel that we created to map diabetes related physiological phenotypes (Stoehr et al. 2000). About 110 of these F<sub>2</sub>-ob/ob mice were also used to map mRNA abundance traits derived by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Lan et al. 2003). The sixty F<sub>2</sub>-ob/ob mice that were used to generate microarray-derived mRNA abundance traits were selected from the 110 mice based on a selective phenotyping algorithm (Jin et al. 2004). The F<sub>2</sub>-ob/ob mice were housed at weaning at the University of Wisconsin-Madison animal care facility on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Mice were provided Purina Formulab Chow 5008 (6.5% fat) and acidified water ad libitum. Mice were killed at 14 weeks of age by CO<sub>2</sub> asphyxiation after a 4-hour fast. The livers, along with other tissues, were immediately foil wrapped and frozen in liquid nitrogen, and subsequently transferred to -80 &deg;C freezers for storage.</blockquote>
