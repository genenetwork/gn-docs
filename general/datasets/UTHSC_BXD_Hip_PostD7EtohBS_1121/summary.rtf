<p>The Affymetrix Genechip Mouse Clariom S was used to examine gene expression (Affymetrix, California, United States). Two hundred nanograms of DNased total RNA was amplified, labeled, and fragmented using Ambion Whole Transcript (WT) Expression Kit according to manufacturer&rsquo;s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Santa Clara, California United States). Briefly, samples are hybridized overnight according to manufacturer&rsquo;s protocols; samples are then washed and stained on Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, California, United States). Samples were then scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Applied Biosystems, California, United States).&nbsp; Data was normalized and analyzed for quality control in Affymetrix Expression Console Software using RMA-sketch normalization (Affymetrix, California, United States). After normalization and quality control, a total number of 22,203 probe sets were used for subsequent data analysis. A total of 128 samples were used&mdash;4 samples per treatment (control, ethanol), sex (male, female), and strain (B6, D2, BXD2, BXD48a, BXD60, BXD71, BXD73, BXD100).</p>
