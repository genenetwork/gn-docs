<p>This is an&nbsp;array&nbsp;data set generated using the&nbsp;Affymetrix Genechip Mouse 1.0 ST array. Please see the companion microRNA (miRNA) data set.</p>

<p>All of these data sets provides estimates of expression&nbsp;for 45 retinas from C57BL/6J (B6 cases B6.01 to B6.17), DBA/2J (cases D2.01 to D2.16), and DBA/2J with a wildtype Gpnmb allele (D2GP.01 to D2GP.12). Cases range in age from 30 to 576 days and include both sexes.</p>

<p>We are using these&nbsp;data in combination with the micro RNA array 4.0 to study normal and glaucomatous changes in gene expression as a function of age.&nbsp;</p>
