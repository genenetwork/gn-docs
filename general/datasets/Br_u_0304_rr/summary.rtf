<p>This August 2005 data freeze provides estimates of mRNA expression in brains of BXD recombinant inbred mice measured using Affymetrix U74Av2 microarrays. Data were generated at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC). Over 300 brain samples from 35 strains were hybridized in small pools (n=3) to 97 arrays. Data were processed using the Microarray Suite 5 (<a class="fs14" href="www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/whitepapers/sadd_whitepaper.pdf">MAS 5</a>) protocol of Affymetrix. To simplify comparison between transforms, MAS 5 values of each array were log2 transformed and adjusted to an average of 8 units. In general, MAS 5 data do not perform as well as RMA, PDNN, or the new heritability weighted transforms (HW1PM).</p>
