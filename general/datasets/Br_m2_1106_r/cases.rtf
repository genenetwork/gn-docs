<p>This data set includes estimates of gene expression for 50 genetically uniform lines of mice: C57BL/6J (B6 or simply B), DBA/2J (D2 or D), 30 BXD recombinant inbred (RI) strain derived by crossing female B6 mice with male D2 mice and then inbreeding progeny for over 21 generations, and 18 other inbred strains of mice available from the Jackson Laboratory. All mice used were na&iuml;ve males from 70-90 days old. This set of RI strains is a remarkable resource because many of these strains have been extensively phenotyped for hundreds of interesting traits over a 25-year period. Another significant advantage of this RI set is that the two parental strains (B6 and D2) have both been extensively sequenced and are known to differ at approximately 1.8 million SNPs. Coding variants (mostly single nucleotide polymorphisms and insertion-deletions) that may produce interesting phenotypes can be rapidly identified in this particular RI set.</p>

<p>In this mRNA expression database we generally used stock obtained directly from The Jackson Laboratory between 2003 and 2005.</p>
