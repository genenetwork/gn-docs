<p>We have exploited a set of BXD recombinant inbred strains. The parental strains from which all BXD lines are derived are C57BL/6J (B) and DBA/2J (D). Both B and D strains have been almost fully sequence (8x coverage for B by a public consortium and approximately 1.5x coverage for D by <a class="fs14" href="http://www.celeradiscoverysystem.com/index.cfm" target="_blank">Celera</a>).</p>

<p>BXD1 through BXD32 were produced by Benjamin A. Taylor starting in the late 1970s. BXD33 through BXD42 were also produced by Taylor, but from a second set of crosses initiated in the early 1990s. These strains are all available from the Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine.</p>
