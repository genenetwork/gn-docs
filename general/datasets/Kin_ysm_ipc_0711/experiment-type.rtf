Human Brain Specimens and Tissue Processing
This study was carried out using post-mortem human brain specimens collected from the
Human Fetal Tissue Repository at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (AECOM).
Dissected tissue was fresh-frozen in Trizol for RNA and DNA extraction, with a post-mortem
interval of less than 1 hour. Remaining tissue was fixed and frozen, and sections were analyzed
for neuropathological or developmental defects. Details of specimens, tissue processing,
microdissection, and neuropathological assessment are given in the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures and Table S1. These studies were approved by the Human
Investigation Committees of AECOM and Yale University.
