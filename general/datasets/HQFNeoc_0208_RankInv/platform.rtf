<p><strong>Illumina Sentrix Mouse-6.1 BeadArray Platform (ILM6v1.1): </strong>The <a class="fs14" href="http://www.illumina.com" target="_blank">Mouse6.1</a> array consists of 46,643 unique probe sequences, each 50 nucleotides in length, that have been arrayed on glass slides using a novel bead technology.</p>

<p>ANNOTATION: In summer of 2008, Xusheng Wang and Robert W. Williams reannotated the Illumina Mouse-6.1 array content. This new annotation is now incorporated into GeneNetwork. For 46643 probes on the Mouse 6.1 array platform (including control probes) we have identified XXXXX NCBI Entrez Gene IDs; XXXXX matched human Gene IDs; XXXXX matched rat Gene IDs; XXXXX NCBI HomoloGene IDs; and XXXXX OMIM IDs.</p>

<p>Position data for the 50-mer Illumina Mouse-6 array were initially downloaded from Sanger at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Users/avc/Illumina/Mouse-6_V1.gff.gz but we then updated all positions by BLAT analysis from mm6 positions to mm8 positions (Hongqiang Li).</p>
