<p>Affymetrix 22K Barley1 GeneChip probe array (http://www.affymetrix.com/products/arrays/specific/barley.affx ; Affymetrix product #900515 GeneChip Barley Genome Array) representing 21,439 non-redundant Barley1 exemplar sequences was derived from worldwide contribution of 350,000 high-quality ESTs from 84 cDNA libraries, in addition to 1,145 barley gene sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology Information non-redundant database (Close et al 2004). Abbreviated annotations were created based on the exemplar sequence homology by Arnis Druka using data from the Harvest (http://harvest.ucr.edu/) data depository.</p>
