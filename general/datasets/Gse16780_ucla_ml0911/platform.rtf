<p>The probe sets were selected from sequences derived from GenBank&reg;, dbEST and RefSeq. The sequence clusters were created from the UniGene database (Build 107, June 2002) and then refined by analysis and comparison with the publicly available draft assembly of the mouse genome from the Whitehead Institute Center for Genome Research (MSCG, April 2002).</p>

<p>Oligonucleotide probes complementary to each corresponding sequence are synthesized in situ on the array. Eleven pairs of oligonucleotide probes, including a perfect match and mismatch probe, are used to measure the level of transcription of each sequence represented on the GeneChip&reg; HT Mouse Genome 430 Array Plate Set.</p>
