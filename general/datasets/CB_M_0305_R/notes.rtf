<p>About the chromosome and megabase position values:</p>

<blockquote>The chromosomal locations of probe sets included on the microarrays were determined by BLAT analysis using the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium March 2005 Assembly (see <a class="fs14" href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat?command=start&amp;org=mouse">http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat?command=start&amp;org=mouse</a>). We thank Dr. Yan Cui (UTHSC) for allowing us to use his Linux cluster to perform this analysis.</blockquote>
