<p>The Phenotypes database of August 2005 provides quantitative trait data for 24 phenotypes from a set of 110 F2 animals generated by crossing strains C57BL/6J and BTBR. All F2s are homozygous for the obese (ob) allele of leptin (<em>Lep</em>) on Chr 6. Data were generated at the University of Wisconsin by Alan Attie and colleagues (Stoehr et al. 2000; Lan et al. 2003). This data release complement the liver transcriptome data described in the paper of Lan and colleagues (in submission, 2005). Traits include body weight, insulin and blood sugar levels, and rtPCR results. To review a complete list of the 24 phenotypes simply type in the wildcard character * in the ANY search field. This data set includes values for all 60 selected animals whose liver mRNA has been quantified using the Affymetrix M430A and B arrays, as well as an addition 50 F2 ob/ob animals from the same cross.</p>

<p>The 110 F<sub>2</sub>-ob/ob mice were chosen from a larger mapping panel that we created to map diabetes related physiological phenotypes (Stoehr et al. 2000). All 110 of this subsetwere used to map mRNA abundance traits derived by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Lan et al. 2003).</p>
