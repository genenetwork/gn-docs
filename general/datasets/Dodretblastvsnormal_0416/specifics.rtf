This is a subtractive dataset.  The Normal retina dataset was subtracted from the blast data set probe by probe to create a data set of the changes occurring following a blast injury to the eye.  This data set can be used to define gene changes following blast. It is not compatible with most of the bioinformatic tools available on GeneNetwork.
