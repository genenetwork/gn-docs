<blockquote>Mammary tumors used in this array experiment were derived from 18 sets of AKXD x FVB/N F1 females as described above. After the primary tumor was diagnosed, the animals were aged an additional 40 days to permit metastatic progression. Females were sacrificed and mammary tumors were harvested. Samples were processed and arrayed on Affymetrix M430A and M430B arrays. The majority of the samples were assayed on arrays obtained from the same lot number.</blockquote>
