<p>The Affymetrix M430 2.0 array consists of approximately 992,936 useful 25-nucleotide probes that estimate the expression of approximately 39,000 transcripts, including a majority of known genes and expressed sequence tags. The array sequences were selected late in 2002 using NCBI Build 107 by Affymetrix. The UTHSC GN group continuously reannotated probe sets on this array, producing more accurate data on probe and probe set targets. All probes have also be aligned to the most recent assembly of the Mouse Genome using Jim Kent&#39;s BLAT program.</p>
