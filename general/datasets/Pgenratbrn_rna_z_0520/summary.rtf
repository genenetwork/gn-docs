<p>This data set was generated as part of the RGAP project funded by NIAAA (R24 AA013162; MPI &ndash; Tabakoff, Hoffman, Saba) at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. The processing of the RNA-Seq data was also supported by the NIDA Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome (P30 DA044223; MPI &ndash; Williams, Saba). These data represent the RNA expression levels of Ensembl genes in brain. Ribosomal RNA depleted total RNA was used to generate paired end libraries. Levels were estimated in 45 (version 5) strains of the Hybrid Rat Diversity Panel (HRDP) including 30 HXB/BXH recombinant inbred strain and 15 classic inbred strains. Two to three biological replicates per strain were included in the strain-level means. Male rats were used for all analyses.</p>
