<p>All animals are females sacrificed&nbsp;as part of an NIA grant to RW Williams to study effects of diet on aging (longevity) &nbsp;in the BXD strains. A subset of females were sacrificed at specific ages for tissue harvesting and fecal pelltets from these animals were removed from the large intestine by K. Mozhui&nbsp;and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to shipping to RTI.</p>

<p>Three large data sets in GeneNetwork with a common set of 4091 metabolite entries per data set (high fat, chow diet, and combined) and for as many as 18 strains.</p>
