<p>Male C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice (10 weeks old upon arrival) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and assigned to either baseline untreated control (BAS),&nbsp;the air control (AIR), or CIE group. Mice were individually housed with free access to food (Harland Teklad, Madison, WI) and water throughout all phases of the experiments. Body weights were recorded weekly during ethanol-drinking weeks or daily during chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) or air exposure (detailed below). Mice were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled an- imal facility under a reversed 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 0200 h). Mice were not food- or water-deprived at any time during the study. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Ani- mal Care and Use Committee at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). Brain tissue was removed at MUSC and shipped to UTHSC for laser capture microdissection (LCM).</p>
