<p>About the cases and families used to generate this set of data:</p>

<p>The text below is taken from Monks et al. (2004). We will add additional new annotation over the next several months.</p>

<p><strong>Families</strong>: Fifteen families from the CEPH/Utah family collection were selected for profiling. The family identifiers were 1334, 1340, 1345, 1346, 1349, 1350, 1358, 1362, 1375, 1377, 1408, 1418, 1421, 1424, and 1477. These families were selected because of the availability of genotypes and lymphoblastoid cell lines for all three generations and because of their large numbers of children. In total, the families represent 210 individuals. Of these, 167 individuals provided adequate quantity and quality of RNA for expression profiling.</p>
