<p>This is a near final release of a spleen gene expression data set generated by a DOD-funded consortium (Byrne, Kotb, Williams, and Lu). Please contact Lu Lu or Robert Williams regarding status of this data set. The initial data enterted in 2010 had many errors described below. The data set is much improved and has no known errors of strain assignment.</p>

<p>Animals were generated at UTHSC by Lu Lu and colleagues. The spleen of untreated young adult mice was profiled using the Affymetrix GeneChip <a href="http://www.affymetrix.com/browse/products.jsp?productId=131476&amp;categoryId=35765#1_1">Mouse Gene 1.0 ST</a> array that contains approximately 34,728 probe sets that target approximately 29,000 well defined transcripts (RefSeq mRNA isoforms) and essentially all known protein coding genes in mouse. This array is an &quot;exon style&quot; array with multiple probes in all known exons of each gene (an average of about 27 per gene) and is an abridged version of the Affymetrix Exon 1.0 ST array. However, it also does contain some probes that target non-coding RNAs and even miRNA precursors (search &quot;ncrna&quot;).</p>
