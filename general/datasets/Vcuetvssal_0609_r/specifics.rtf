Expression analysis was conducted by estimating the relative abundance of over 45,000 transcripts in the VTA in response to ethanol or saline and transforming these data using the S-score method to compare ethanol vs. saline expression from pairs of arrays for each strain (Kerns et al., Methods 31:274, 2003).
