<p>The Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx) aims to create a comprehensive public atlas of gene expression and regulation across multiple human tissues. The resource will provide valuable insights in to the mechanisms of gene regulation, aid in the interpretation of genome wide association studies, and enable studies of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), alternative splicing, and the tissue speciï¬city of gene regulatory mechanisms.</p>

<p>The GTEx project recently completed an initial pilot phase during which &gt;185 donor DNAs were genotyped using high density SNP and exome arrays. RNA expression was proï¬led on multiple tissues from these donors (from 9 to 30) by both array-based methods and RNA sequencing, to an average depth of 50 million reads. These pilot phase data have been made available to the public through davailable through the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000424.v1.p1" target="_blank">database of Genotype and Phenotype (dbGaP)</a>.</p>
