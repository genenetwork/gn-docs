<p>Livers were later shattered in liquid nitrogen and ~100 mg fragments were taken at random from the left, right, or caudate lobes. To account for this discrepancy, all ~5 animals per cohort had their RNA prepared, and then were pooled evenly (by &micro;g of RNA) into a single RNA sample for each cohort. These pooled RNA samples of approximately 30 &micro;g RNA were then purified using RNEasy, then sent out for array analysis. All RIN values were &gt; 8.0.&nbsp;</p>
