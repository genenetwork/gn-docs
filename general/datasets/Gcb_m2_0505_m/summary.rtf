Data were generated by <a href="http://www.genomeexplorations.com/" target="_blank">Genome Explorations Inc.</a> (Divyen Patel and colleagues). Cerebellar samples were hybridized in small pools (<em>n</em> = 3) to Affymetrix M430 2.0 arrays. This particular data set was processed using the <a href="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/whitepapers/sadd_whitepaper.pdf">Microarray Suite 5</a></p>
