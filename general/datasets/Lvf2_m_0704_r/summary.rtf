<p>This August 2005 data freeze provides estimates of mRNA expression in adult liver from a selected set of 60 F2 animals generated by crossing strain C57BL/6J-ob/+ with BTBR and then intercrossing the F1-ob/+ progeny. The F2 progeny included, in a total of 350 progeny, 110 ob/ob progeny homozygous for the obese (ob) allele of leptin (<em>Lep</em>) on Chr 6. Sixty of the ob/ob progeny were selected for expression assays. This selection means that the data set is not useful for defining QTLs on Chr 6. Array data were generated at the University of Wisconsin by Alan Attie and colleagues. This data release accompanies the paper of Lan and colleagues (in submission, 2005). A set of 24 complementary phenotypes such as body weight, blood chemistry, and rtPCR results, are also available for these animals and an additional set of 50 F2s (see <strong>Phenotypes</strong> database. Samples were hybridized to 60 pairs of Affymetrix M430A and B arrays. This particular data set was processed using the <a class="fs14" href="http://stat-www.berkeley.edu/users/bolstad/RMAExpress/RMAExpress.html" target="_blank">RMA</a> normalization method. To simplify comparison among transforms, RMA values of each array were adjusted to an average of 8 units and a standard deviation of two units.</p>
