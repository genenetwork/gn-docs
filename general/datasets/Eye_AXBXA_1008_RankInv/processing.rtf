<p><b>Sample Processing:</b> Samples were processed by Lu Lu and colleagues in the Illumina Core at UTHSC between August 2008 and September 2008. All processing steps were performed by Dr. David Li. In brief, RNA purity was evaluated using the 260/280 nm absorbance ratio, and values had to be greater than 1.8 to pass our quality control (QC). The majority of samples had values between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was assessed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. The standard Eberwine T7 polymerase method was used to catalyze the synthesis of cDNA template from polyA-tailed RNA using the Ambion/Illumina (http://www.ambion.com/catalog/CatNum.php?AMIL1791) TotalPrep RNA amplication kit (Cat#IL1791). The biotin labeled cRNA was then evaluated using both the 260/280 ratio (values of 2.0-2.3 are acceptable) using a NanoDrop ND-1000 (http://www.nanodrop.com/nd-1000-overview.html). Those samples that passed QC steps (approximately 10% failed and new RNA samples had to be acquired and processed) were immediately used on BeadChips. The slides were hybridized and washed following standard Illumina protocols.</p>

<p><b>Replication and Sample Balance:</b> We obtained a male sample pool and female sample pool from 25 of the 28 strains. Three strains are represented by samples from a single sex.</p>
