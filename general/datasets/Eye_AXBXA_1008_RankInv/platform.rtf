<p><b><a class="fs14" href="http://www.illumina.com/pages.ilmn?ID=198" target="_empty">Illumina Sentrix MouseWG-6 v2 BeadChip</a>: </b>This array consists of 45,281 unique probe sequences, each 50 nucleotides in length, that have been arrayed on glass slides using a novel bead technology.</p>

<p>ANNOTATION: In the summer of 2008, Xusheng Wang and Robert W. Williams reannotated all three Illumina Mouse 6 BeadChips, including the array used to process the AXB/BXA eye samples. This new annotation is now incorporated into GeneNetwork. The annotation file can be accessed at <a href="http://www.genenetwork.org/share/annotations/">http://www.genenetwork.org/share/annotations/</a>, by selecting &quot;Illumina Mouse WG-6 v2.0 (GPL6887)&quot;.</p>

<p>Position data for the 50-mer Illumina probe sequences were aligned to the mm8 mouse genome build by Xusheng Wang as part of his master annotation of all Illumina mouse arrays. Manual annotation of this array was usually done by RW Williams.</p>
