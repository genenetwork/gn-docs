<p>The <a class="fs14" href="http://www.genenetwork.org/mouseCross.html#AXBXA" target="_empty">AXB/BXA</a> genetic reference panel of recombinant inbred strains consists of just about 26 fully independent strains. All of these strains are fully inbred, many well beyond the 100th filial (F) generation of inbreeding. All of these strains were been genotyped at 13,377 SNPs in 2005 (Shifman et al., 2006).</p>
