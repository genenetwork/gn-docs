<p><strong>Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array: </strong>The <a class="fs14" href="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=moe430-20" target="_blank">430v2</a> array consists of 992936 useful 25-nucleotide probes that estimate the expression of approximately 16,578 NCBI Reference Sequences. The array sequences were selected late in 2002 using Unigene Build 107 by Affymetrix. The annotation used in this data set assigns probes to probe sets based on their alignment to Entrez GeneID sequences using the latest Mouse Genome assembly (Build 36, mm8).</p>
