<p>Error-correcting for the genotypes for the first 96 EtOH-sensitived B6xD2 F2-S4 cases it&#39;s done. Genotypes are good and the kinship matrix and family structure all makes sense. You can certainly detect the family structure of this six generation cross. This data set can only be mapped correctly using your new Py-LMM code in GeneNetwork 2.</p>
