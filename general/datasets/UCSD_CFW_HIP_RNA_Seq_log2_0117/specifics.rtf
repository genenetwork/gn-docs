<p>Notes: We took the raw fpkm values provided by Apurva from file GN811-UCSD_CFW_RNA-Seq_HIP_raw_FPKM.txt.zip (11M) and transformed to log2 Z-scored. (GN811-UCSD_CFW_RNA-Seq_HIP_log2_ZScore.txt.zip (4.0M))</p>

<p>RNA-Seq Log2 Z-score</p>

<p>In general, the array data that we put in GeneNetwork has been logged and then z normalized, but instead of leaving the mean at 0 and the standard deviation of 1 unit, we shift up to a mean of 8 units and increase the spread by having a standard deviation of 2 units (what we call 2Z + 8 normalized data). &nbsp;This removes negative values from the tables.</p>
