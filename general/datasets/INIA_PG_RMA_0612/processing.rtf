<p>Conventional Affymetrix gene level probe summarization (RMA) followed by log2 transformation and standard GeneNetwork variance stabilization (2z +8). The z scores are multiplied by 2 and we then add a value of 8 to all values. This eliminates negative values and results in a scale of expression for which 1 unit is roughly equivalent to a two fold absolute difference in mRNA concentration.</p>
