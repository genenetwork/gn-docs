<p><strong>Affymetrix 430A and 430B GeneChip Set:</strong> Expression data were generated using 430AB array pairs. The chromosomal locations of probe sets were determined by <a class="fs14" href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat?command=start&amp;org=mouse" target="_blank">BLAT</a> analysis of concatenated probe sequences using the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium May 2004 (mm5) assembly. This BLAT analysis is performed periodically by Yanhua Qu as each new build of the mouse genome is released. We thank Yan Cui (UTHSC) for allowing us to use his Linux cluster to perform this analysis. It is possible to confirm the BLAT alignment results yourself simply by clicking on either the <strong>Verify UCSC</strong> and <strong>Verify Ensembl</strong> links in the Trait Data and Editing Form (right side of the <strong>Location</strong> line).</p>
