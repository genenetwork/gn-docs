<p><strong>Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array: </strong>The <a class="normal" href="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=moe430-20" target="_blank">430v2</a> array consists of 992936 useful 25-nucleotide probes that estimate the expression of approximately 39,000 transcripts (many are actually duplicates). The array sequences were selected late in 2002 using Unigene Build 107. The array nominally contains the same probe sequence as the 430A and B series. However, we have found that roughy 75000 probes differ from those on A and B arrays.</p>
