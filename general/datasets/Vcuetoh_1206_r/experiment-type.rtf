This data set was generated concurrently with the VCU saline prefrontal cortex BXD RMA data and therefore consisted of 64 microarrays processed in 5 groups of 8 to 16 microarrays during the month of September 2006. All RNA extractions, cRNA synthesis, and hybridizations were randomized across strain and treatment groups to minimize batch effects.
<P>Many of the techniques used to generate this data set are described in a recent publication in the <A HREF="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/25/9/2255" class="fs14"  target="_empty">Journal of Neuroscience</A>.</p>
