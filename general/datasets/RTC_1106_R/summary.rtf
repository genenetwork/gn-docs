<blockquote>ERROR-CHECKED FIRST PHASE PRIVATE TEST DATA SET. This data set provides estimates of gene expression in <a class="fs14" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell" target="_empty">regulatory T cells</a> (CD4+CD25+) of BXD strains. Data were generated by Prof. Dr. Klaus Schughart and colleagues at the <a class="fs14" href="http://www.helmholtz-hzi.de/en/" target="_empty">Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research (HZI)</a>. Samples were processed using a total of 35 Affymetrix MOE 430 2.0 short oligomer microarrays, of which 33 passed stringent quality control and error checking.
<p>This is a private test data set. Please contact Dr. Klaus Schughart for early access.</p>
