<p>BXD animals were obtained from UTHSC, and the Jackson Laboratory (Table 1). Animals were housed at UTHSC, at Harvard/BIDMC (Glenn Rosen), at the University of Memphis (Douglas Matthews), or the Jackson Laboratory before sacrifice (see Table 1). Mice were killed by cervical dislocation and kidneys were removed and placed in RNAlater prior to dissection. Kidneys were dissected whole and cleaned from the adrenal glands by Hong Tao Zhang in Dr. Lu&rsquo;s lab. Kidneys from two to six animals per strain were pooled and shipped to Kremena Star at Mount Sinai School of Medicine (MSSM). Animals used in this study were between 50 and 99 days of age (average of 62 days; see Table 1).</p>
