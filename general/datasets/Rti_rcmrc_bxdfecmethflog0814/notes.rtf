<p>For symbols of metabolites if the differences were greater than .0003 proportional m/z units (m/z difference divided by m/z value) then the symbol was labeled &quot;circa&quot; after the atomic composition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For description of metabolites if the proportional difference of the m/z ratio between Evan&#39;s EPFL Polar metabolite&nbsp;assignments and RTI assignments was very low (&lt;.0001 proportional m/z units) then the symbol and description was taken directly from Evan&#39;s metabolite file, but if differences were between 0.0001 and about .0003 proportional m/z units then the descriptions were labeled &quot;Putative&quot; . If the differences were greater than .0003 units, then the descriptions were labeled &quot;Provisional&quot;. For example,<span style="background-color:rgb(238, 238, 238); color:rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family:verdana,geneva,lucida,lucida grande,arial,helvetica">&nbsp;&quot;P</span><span style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family:verdana,geneva,lucida,lucida grande,arial,helvetica; font-size:12px">rovisional assignment. Vanilpyruvic acid is a catecholamine metabolite and precursor to vanilactic acid. Accumulation in urine is indicative of Aromatic L-aminoacid decarboxylase deficiency (PMID 16288991).&quot;&nbsp;</span></p>
