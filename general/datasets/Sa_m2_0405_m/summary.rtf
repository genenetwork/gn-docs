<blockquote>This April 2005 data freeze provides estimates of mRNA expression in the <a class="normalsize" href="http://www.nervenet.org/NetPapers/Rosen/Striatum2001/StriatumMain.html" target="_blank">striatum</a> (caudate nucleus of the forebrain) of 33 lines of mice including C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, and 31 BXD recombinant inbred strains. Data were generated using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 short oligomer microarrays at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (<a class="normalsize" href="http://www.bidmc.harvard.edu/sites/bidmc/home.aspBIDMC" target="_blank">BIDMC</a>, Boston MA) by Glenn D. Rosen with the support of a Human Brain Project (HBP) grant. Approximately 250 brain samples (males and females) from 33 strains were used in this experiment. Samples were hybridized to a total of 59 arrays. This particular data set was processed using the Microarray Suite 5 protocol (<a class="normalsize" href="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/whitepapers/sadd_whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank">MAS 5</a>). To simplify comparison among different transforms, MAS5 values of each array have been adjusted to an average expression of 8 units and a standard deviation of 2 units.</blockquote>
