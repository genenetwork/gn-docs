<p><strong>About array data processing and analysis:</strong></p>

<p>RNA samples (n = 180) were processed using a total of 30 Illumina HumanWG-6 BeadChips, each beadchip analyses six samples covering 48,000 transcripts per sample. All chips passed quality control and error checking. This data set was extracted and processed using the Bead Studio 3. We applied Rank-invariant normalization to all the samples and the resulting expression values along with gene ID were exported in GeneSpring format. Dr. Rita Kansal performed the normalization steps.</p>
