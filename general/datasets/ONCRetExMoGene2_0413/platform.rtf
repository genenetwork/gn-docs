<p>The Affymetrics GeneChip&amp;reg; Mouse Gene 2.0 ST microarrays. This relatively recent microarray was specifically designed to represent the whole-transcriptome. It includes probes to measure mRNA, long intergenic non-coding RNAs and microRNAs. Researchers have identified many transcripts in the mouse genome that do not have protein coding potential. Most of these non-coding RNAs have little functional annotation. Nonetheless, there is considerable evidence that these non-coding RNAs play important roles in development of the retina and the progression of disease. The coverage in the new ST 2.0 array includes over 28,000 coding transcripts and over 7,000 non-coding transcripts. There are also probes on the array covering 590 microRNAs.</p>
