<p>Monocytes from single optic nerve heads or from peripheral blood (restrained cheek bleed) were FAC sorted into 100&thinsp;&mu;l buffer RLT&thinsp;+&thinsp;1% &beta;ME and frozen at &minus;&thinsp;80&thinsp;&deg;C until further processing. Samples were defrosted on ice and homogenized by syringe in RLT Buffer (total volume 300&thinsp;&mu;l). Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy micro kits as according to manufacturer&rsquo;s protocols (Qiagen) including the optional DNase treatment step, and quality was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The concentration was determined using a Ribogreen Assay from Invitrogen. Amplified dscDNA libraries were created using a Nugen Ovation RNA-seq System V2 and a primer titration was performed to remove primer dimers from the sample to allow sample inputs as low as 50&thinsp;pg RNA. The SPIA dscDNA was sheared to 300&thinsp;bp in length using a Diogenode Disruptor. Quality control was performed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and a DNA 1000 chip assay. Library size produced was analysed using qPCR using the Library Quantitation kit/Illumina GA /ABI Prism (Kapa Biosystems). Libraries were barcoded, pooled, and sequenced 6 samples per lane on a HiSeq 2000 sequencer (Illumina) giving a depth of 30&ndash;35 million reads per sample.</p>

<p>Following RNA-sequencing samples were subjected to quality control analysis by a custom quality control python script. Reads with 70% of their bases having a base quality score&thinsp;&ge;&thinsp;30 were retained for further analysis. Read alignment was performed using TopHat v 2.0.7 [<a aria-label="Reference 34" data-test="citation-ref" data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" href="https://molecularneurodegeneration.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13024-018-0303-3#ref-CR34" id="ref-link-section-d88755e1228" title="Kim D, Pertea G, Trapnell C, Pimentel H, Kelley R, Salzberg SL.

Normalization was performed using the trimmed mean of M values (TMM). Unsupervised HC was performed in R (1-cor, Spearman&rsquo;s&nbsp;<i>rho</i>). Following preliminary analysis, 1 sample was removed as an outlier. Adjustment for multiple testing was performed using false discovery rate (FDR). Genes were considered to be significantly differentially expression at a false discovery rate (FDR;&nbsp;<i>q</i>) of&nbsp;<i>q</i>&thinsp;&lt;&thinsp;0.05. Pathway analysis was performed in R, IPA (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, Qiagen), and using publically available tools (see&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-action="section anchor" data-track-label="link" href="https://molecularneurodegeneration.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13024-018-0303-3#Sec15">Results</a>).</p>
