<p><strong>FHB and DON assays </strong><br />
Parents and DH progeny from the Steptoe/Morex were assessed for FHB severity (in %) and DON accumulation (in ppm) at three different environments in 1994 and 1995: Fargo, ND in both 1994 and 1995 and Langdon, ND in 1995. A randomized complete block design was used in the three environments and included a single replicate. Progeny and parents were planted in short rows (10-20 seeds) spaced 0.33 cm apart in two adjacent rows. Planting, maintenance of plots, and inoculation protocols were as described by (Prom et al. 1997). Disease assessments were made when the parents and DH progeny were at the mid-dough stage of development (growth stage 84-86) (Zadoks et al. 1974). The percent severity of FHB was determined by counting the number of infected kernels (those with greater than one-fourth of their surface area showing disease symptoms) and dividing that quantity by the total number of kernels in that spike multiplied by 100 (Prom et al. 1997). These assessments were made on 10-20 randomly selected spikes per plot as described by Prom et al. (1997). When the plants were mature, all spikes from each plot were harvested, dried, and threshed. DON assays were made using the method developed by Tacke and Casper (Tacke and Casper 1996). For this assay, a random six-gram sample of seed was used from each parent and DH line (Prom et al. 1999).</p>

General description<br />
Disease severity was assessed at seedling stage in a greenhouse chamber. Therefore, the plants were sown and grown at a temperature of 16-18&deg;C in 9x9 cm plastic pots whereas each line was represented by four individuals. The plants were inoculated at the three-leaves stage, approximately 20 days after sowing. The parents as well as some differential genotypes (resistant: Atlas; susceptible: Alexis, Hendrix, Steffi) were included as internal controls.<br />
The single-spore isolate 271 (Stra&szlig;moos, Bavaria) of R. secalis, provided by Dr. Sachs, BBA Kleinmachnow, was grown for approximately 20 days on Lima bean agar (Difco, Detroit, USA) in Petri-dishes at 16&deg;C in the dark. The spores were harvested after addition of water by gently rubbing of the mycel with a glass rod. The advanced spore suspension was decanted, filtrated and adjusted to 2-300.000 spores/ml. One inoculum preparation was used for the inoculation of all seedlings. by covering the inoculated plants with black plastic hoods for 48 hours high humidity and darkness were maintained to provide optimal infection conditions. 10-14 days after infection plants were assessed visually for scald symptoms on the lamina of the second leaf approximately according to the scale described by Jackson &amp; Webster (1976). The third leaf was later consult to verify the infection. The final score of scald severity per DH line was achieved by averaging the scoring results of the four included plants.<br />
<br />
Detailed description<br />
The Steptoe/Morex DH mapping population and reference cultivars were tested for reaction to Rhynchosporium secalis according to Schweizer et al. 1995 with some modifications. The single-spore isolate &ldquo;271&rdquo; (Stra&szlig;moos, LfL-Bavaria, Germany) of R. secalis, provided by Dr. Sachs was grown for approximately 20 days on 2.3% (w/v) Lima bean agar (Difco Laboratories) in Petri-dishes at 16&deg;C in the dark. For inoculation a conidial suspension was prepared by rinsing the plates with water and filtering the mycel through gauze. The spore concentration was adjusted to 200.000 spores/ml-1. One inoculum preparation was used for all seedlings in a given experiment.<br />
Seedlings at the 2- to 3-leaf stage (3 weeks after sowing) were sprayed uniformly with inoculum (approximately 0.25 ml per plant) and left for 20 min to dry. Inoculated plants were then lightly sprayed with water and kept for 48h in a dark moist chamber at 18&deg;C. DH lines (four independent plants/DH line) were assessed 10-14 days after inoculation visually for scald symptoms on the lamina of the second leaf (the third leaf was used as further control) according to the scale described by Jackson &amp; Webster (1976). Differential genotypes &acute;Atlas&acute; (res) and &acute;Steffi&acute; (susc) and the parents Steptoe and Morex were used as reference cultivars.</p>

<p><em>Seedling evaluations</em><br />
For seedling evaluations, four to six seeds of parents and DH lines were sown in plastic cones (3.8 cm diameter and 21 cm length) filled with a peat moss:perlite (3:1) potting mix and grown at 22-26C in a greenhouse. Fertilization was provided at planting with water soluble (15-0-15, N-P-K) and controlled release (14-14-14, N-P-K) formulations. When the second leaves of plants were fully expanded (14 days after planting), inoculations were made with conidial suspensions of the individual pathogens using an atomizer pressured by an air pump at 414 kPa. Inoculations with isolate ND89-19 of P. t. f. teres and ND85F of C. sativus were made using a concentration of 5,000 and 8,000 conidia/ml, respectively. The volume of the inoculum suspension applied to each plant was approximately 0.15 ml. To facilitate even distribution and adherence of conidia, 10 ul of Tween&reg; 20 (polyoxyethylene-20-sorbitan monolaurate) was added for every 100 ml of the inoculum suspension. Plants were allowed to dry slightly after inoculation before being placed in chambers maintained near saturation by periodic mistings from ultrasonic humidifiers. After a 16 hour infection period in complete darkness, the plants were allowed to dry slowly for approximately four hours before being returned to the greenhouse. Assessments of the infection response (IR) were made 9--11 days post-inoculation using the rating scale of Tekauz (1985) for net blotch and Fetch and Steffenson (1999) for spot blotch. The experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design with two replicates and was repeated twice.</p>

<p><em>Adult plant evaluations</em><br />
Parents and DH lines were also evaluated to the net and spot blotch pathogens in the field at Langdon and Fargo, North Dakota, respectively. The host entries were sown in hill plots (8--15 seeds/hill) spaced 0.3 m apart in paired rows. Susceptible barley genotypes (cultivar Hector for net blotch and line ND 5883 for spot blotch) were planted around the paired rows of hill plots to increase disease development in the nurseries. When most of the DH lines were at the mid-tillering stage of development, the susceptible spreader plants were inoculated with barley straw infected with either isolate ND89-19 of P. t. f. teres or ND85F of C. sativus. This infected barley straw was taken from the previous season&#39;s crop at the respective locations. Assessments of disease severity (percentage of leaf area affected by disease) were made at the mid-dough stage of development using standard disease area diagrams (Burleigh and Loubane [1984] for net blotch and James [1971] for spot blotch). The experimental design was a randomized complete block with three replications. Evaluations for net blotch reaction were made in 1991 only and for spot blotch both in 1991 and 1992.</p>

<p><em>Disease evaluations at seedling plant stage</em><br />
The standard barley leaf rust isolate 1.2.1 (P. hordei Otth) was used to evaluate the level of partial resistance of the 150 DH lines of StMx at seedling stage in a greenhouse compartment. The disease experiments were conducted in six replications in time and within each replication one seedling of each DH line was inoculated. The seeds were sown in trays of 37 x 39 cm, each of them containing two rows of 10&ndash;15 seeds. In each tray one seed of each parental line, Steptoe and Morex and of the control lines, L94 and Vada, were sown. The inoculation was performed with about 200 spores per cm2. The latency period (LP) on each seedling was evaluated and the relative latency period (RLP50S) was calculated, relative to the LP on L94.</p>

<p><em>Stem rust infection phenotyping</em><br />
Each of the St/Mx DH lines was challenged with the stem rust fungus race Pgt-MCC in 5 replications over 2 years (1990 and 1991). Phenotypic scores were made 12 to 14 days after inoculation according to the infection type (IT) scale of Stakman et al. (1962) as modified by Miller and Lambert (Miller and Lambert 1965). Under the Stakman system, IT 0 indicates no visible infection; only a necrotic &ldquo;fleck&rdquo; (i.e. hypersensitive response) with no sporulation; IT 1 designates a minute uredinium (i.e. sporulating pustule) surrounded by necrosis; IT 2 designates a small uredinium often surrounded by chlorosis; IT 3 designates a moderate sized uredinium sometimes surrounded by chlorosis; and IT 4 designates a large uredinium. Since barley exhibits chlorosis in association with most ITs (excluding IT 0, and IT 1), Miller and Lambert modified the Stakman system and classified ITs 2, 3, and 4 on the basis of uredinium size alone. Barley often exhibits a mixture of different ITs on a single plant&mdash;the &ldquo;mesothetic&rdquo; reaction described by Stakman et al (1962). ITs on the St/Mx DH lines were recorded according to prevalence. In most cases, the one or two most common ITs comprised over 75% of the total observed and were used to assign the general binary classes of resistant and susceptible. ITs 0, 1 and 2 were<br />
3 considered indicative of host resistance (i.e. a low infection type), whereas IT 3 and 4<br />
4 were indicative of host susceptibility (a high infection type). The classic &ldquo;diamond<br />
5 shaped&rdquo; uredinium of IT 4 was not observed on plants in the St/Mx population.</p>

<p><strong>Emergence of the second leaf (SCRI) </strong><br />
Seeds of all 150 recombinant lines from the Steptoe x Morex DH population and the parents, Steptoe and Morex were planted in the 24 x 30 cm pots filled with the &lsquo;Cereal Mix&rsquo; and placed on the automatically irrigated glasshouse benches (cubicle AO59). Three sterilized seeds per line were sown in each of four replicate pots. Placement of the pots was randomized across the glasshouse space. Temperature in the cubicle was set at 20&deg; with 16-hr light/15&deg; 8-hr dark periods. Intensity of the supplementary light was 400 &micro;E m&ndash;1 sec&ndash;1.</p>

<p><strong>Single leaf frequency </strong><br />
After 20 days, seedlings were counted based on number of emerged visible leaves (either single or two). Frequency of the single leaf across all four replicates within the recombinant line was used for QTL mapping.</p>

<p><em>Ratio</em><br />
The lengths of the leaf blades were measured for the seedlings that have two visible leaves. Ratio of the length of both blades was used for QTL mapping.</p>

<p><em>Morphological and agronomic trait assessment</em><br />
Various morphological (especially spike characters) and agronomic traits may affect the development of FHB on lines in the field (Steffenson 2003). To determine the possible contribution of such factors on FHB severity, assessments were made on heading date, plant height, spike, and the number of nodes per cm of rachis in the spike (kernel density). Heading date was defined as the number of days from planting to when 50% of the plants in a plot had emerged spikes. Plant height was the number of cm from the ground to the tip of the spike, excluding the awns. Spike angle was rated at maturity on a scale of 1 to 3 where spikes bending less than 45 degrees from vertical were scored as 1; those bending from 45-120 degrees from vertical were scored as 2, and those bending greater than 120 degrees from vertical were scored as 3. The number of nodes per cm of rachis was measured on four randomly selected spikes for each parent and DH line.</p>

<p><em>Dormancy as measured by germination tests</em><br />
Dormancy defined as the failure of viable mature seed to germinate under favorable conditions was measured indirectly by measuring germination percentage, as there is no known direct test for dormancy. Two different after-ripening periods (0 and 14 days) were included in the study to measure the state of and change in dormancy over time. Genetic sub-traits for dormancy based on physiological activity/state could include the development of dormancy as seeds mature, the state of dormancy at maturity, and the dissipation of dormancy with time following maturity. The latter two situations were considered in this study. Germination percentage has also been used to measure susceptibility/resistance to preharvest sprouting (PHS) as well, but it is also a very indirect measure, which assumes that dormancy is the opposite of PHS, which may or may not be entirely true.</p>

<p>Seeds were harvested at physiological maturity (as determined when green color was lost from the spike). Heads were collected and stored in a -20&deg;C freezer prior to germination tests of the seeds to arrest physiological activity. Germination tests were carried out after two different post-harvest after-ripening periods at room temperature; 0 d and 14 d for materials grown in field and glasshouse environments. For each after-ripening period, two replications of 100 seeds were germinated at 20&deg;C on moist filter paper in a petri dish. Standard germination tests were performed (AOSA 1988). After 7 d the number of germinated seeds were counted and expressed as a percentage of the total.</p>
