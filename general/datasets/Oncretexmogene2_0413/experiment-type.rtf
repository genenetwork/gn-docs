Dissecting and preparing eyes for RNA extraction

RNA was extracted from retinas using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and the Quiagen Qiacube.  For RNA amplification and cDNA preparation we used the AmbionÂ® WT Expression Kit  (Life Technologies Cat#: 4411974).  For Fragmentation and Labeling the WT Terminal Labeling Kit from Affymetrix (Cat#: 900671) was used.
