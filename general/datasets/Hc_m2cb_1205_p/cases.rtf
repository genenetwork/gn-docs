<p>The <a class="normalsize" href="http://www.genenetwork.org/mouseCross.html#BXD" target="_empty">BXD</a> genetic reference panel of recombinant inbred strains consists of just over 80 strains. The BXDs in this data set include 27 of the BXD strains made by Benjamin Taylor at the Jackson Laboratory in the 1970s and 1990s (BXD1 through BXD42). All of these strains are fully inbred, many well beyond the 100th filial (F) generation of inbreeding. We have also included 39 inbred (25 strains at F20+) and nearly inbred (14 strains between F14 and F20) BXD lines generated by Lu and Peirce. All of these strains, including those between F14 and F20, have been genotyped at 13,377 SNPs.</p>

<p><strong>Mouse Diversity Panel (MDP)</strong>. We have profiled a MDP consisting 16 inbred strains and a pair of reciprocal F1 hybrids; B6D2F1 and D2B6F1. These strains were selected for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>genetic and phenotypic diversity, including use by the <a class="normalsize" href="http://aretha.jax.org/pub-cgi/phenome/mpdcgi?rtn=strains%2Flist&amp;listmode=pri&amp;typemode=all&amp;genaltmode=no&amp;submit1=%A0%A0Go%A0%A0" target="_empty">Phenome Project</a></li>
	<li>their use in making genetic reference populations including recombinant inbred strains, cosomic strains, congenic and recombinant congenic strains</li>
	<li>their use by the <a class="normalsize" href="http://www.complextrait.org" target="_empty">Complex Trait Consortium</a> to make the Collaborative Cross (Nairobi/Wellcome, Oak Ridge/DOE, and Perth/UWA)</li>
	<li>genome sequence data from three sources (NHGRI, Celera, and Perlegen-NIEHS)</li>
	<li>availability from The Jackson Laboratory</li>
</ul>

<p>All eight parents of the Collaborative Cross (129, A, C57BL/6J, CAST, NOD, NZO, PWK, and WSB) have been included in the MDP (noted below in the list). Twelve MDP strains have been sequenced, or are currently being resequenced by Perlegen for the NIEHS. This panel will be extremely helpful in systems genetic analysis of a wide variety of traits, and will be a powerful adjunct in fine mapping modulators using what is essentially an association analysis of sequence variants.</p>

<p>We have not combined data from reciprocal F1s because they have different Y chromosome and mitochondrial haplotypes. Parent-of-origin effects (imprinting, maternal environment) may also lead to interesting differences in hippocampal transcript levels.</p>

<p>These strains are available from The Jackson Laboratory. BXD43 through BXD100 strains are available from Lu Lu and colleagues at UTHSC.</p>
