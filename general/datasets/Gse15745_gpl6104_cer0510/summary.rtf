<p><strong>Summary from GEO <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE36192" target="_blank">Series GSE36192</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE36194" target="_blank">GSE: GSE36194</a></strong> &quot;A fundamental challenge in the post-genome era is to understand and annotate the consequences of genetic variation, particularly within the context of human tissues. We describe a set of integrated experiments designed to investigate the effects of common genetic variability on mRNA expression distinct human brain regions. We show that brain tissues may be readily distinguished based on expression profile. We find an abundance of genetic cis regulation mRNA expression. We observe that the largest magnitude effects occur across distinct brain regions. We believe these data, which we have made publicly available, will be useful in understanding the biological effects of genetic variation.&quot;</p>
