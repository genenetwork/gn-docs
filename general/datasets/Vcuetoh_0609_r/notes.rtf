<p>All samples were processed by Nate Bruce at VCU between April and May 2009. The BioRad Experion RNA analyzer and used to assess total RNA integrity and verify equal molar ratios of 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA. All RNA Quality Index (RQI) calculations were &gt; 8. Standard Affymetrix reagents and protocols were used for generation of cDNA and biotinylated cRNA from total RNA samples. Integrity of cRNA was checked by Experion analysis prior to microarray hybridizations. All probes exceeded a maximum size of 3000 nt for the upper border of the cRNA size distribution.</p>
