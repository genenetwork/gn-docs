<p>About the animals and tissue used to generate this set of data:</p>

<p>All animals were raised at the IBG by Bennett and colleagues in an SPF facility. No cases were MHV positive. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation. Whole brain dissections were performed at the IBG by Bennett and colleagues and shipped in RNAlater to Lu Lu and colleagues at UTHSC. Most hippocampal dissections (all were bilateral) were performed by Zhiping Jia. Cerebella, olfactory bulbs, and brain stems were also dissected and stored at -80 deg C using further use. Hippocampal samples are very close to complete (see Lu et al., 2001 but probably include variable amounts of fimbria and choroid plexus (see expression of transthyretin, Ttr, as a marker of choroid plexus).</p>

<p>A pool of dissected tissue from four hippocampi taken from two naive adults of the same strain, sex, and age was collected in one session and used to generate RNA samples. The great majority (75%) of animals were sacrificed between 9:30 AM and 11:30 AM. All animals were sacrificed between 9 AM and 5 PM during the light phase. All RNA samples were extracted at UTHSC by Zhiping Jia.</p>

<p>All animals used in this study were between 53 and 90 days of age (average of 72 days; see Table 1 below).</p>
