<p>RNA-Seq log2 Z-Score</p>

<p>In general, the array data that we put in GeneNetwork has been logged and then z normalized, but instead of leaving the mean at 0 and the standard deviation of 1 unit, we shift up to a mean of 8 units and increase the spread by having an standard deviation of 2 units (what we call 2Z + 8 normalized data). &nbsp;This removes negative values from the tables.</p>
