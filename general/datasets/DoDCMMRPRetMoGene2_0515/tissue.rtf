<p>Tissue preparation protocol. Mice were killed by rapid cervical dislocation. Retinas were removed immediately and placed in 1 ml of 160 U/ml Ribolock for 1 min at room temperature. The retinas were removed from the eye and placed in Hank&rsquo;s Balanced Salt solution with RiboLock in 50&micro;l Ribolock (Thermo Scientific RiboLock RNase #EO0381 40U/&micro;l 2500U) and stored in -80&deg;C. The RNA was isolated using a QiaCube and the in column DNAse procedure. All RNA samples were checked for quality before running microarrays. The samples were analyzed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The RNA integrity values for ranged from 7.0 to 10. Our goal was to obtain data for independent biological sample pools from both sexes for most lines of mice. The four batches of arrays included in this final data set, collectively represent a reasonably well-balanced sample of males and females, in general without within-strain-by-sex replication.</p>
