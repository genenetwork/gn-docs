<p>BXD recombinant inbred mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and upon arrival were housed under clean conventional conditions in the Central Animal Facility of the University of Groningen, Netherlands. We used female mice between 3 and 6 months old.</p>

<p>Stem cells (described below) were isolated from pooled bone marrow obtained from three BXD animals per strain. Pooled RNA samples were split in two aliquots and each sample was independently amplified and hybridized to the U74Av2 array (3 mice x 2 arrays).</p>
