<p>About the strains used to generate this set of data</p>

<p>The BXD genetic reference panel of recombinant inbred strains consists of just over 80 strains. The BXDs in this data set include 28 of the BXD strains made by Benjamin Taylor at the Jackson Laboratory in the 1970s and 1990s (BXD1 through BXD42). All of these strains are fully inbred, many well beyond the 100th filial (F) generation of inbreeding. We have also included 4 new inbred strains BXD (F21+) generated by Lu and Peirce. All of these strains were been genotyped at 13,377 SNPs in 2005 (Shifman et al., 2006).</p>
