<p>This August 2003 freeze provides estimates of mRNA expression in brains of BXD recombinant inbred mice measured using Affymetrix U74Av2 microarrays. This is data set includes six arrays which are of marginal quality. New users are encouraged to use one of the more recent data sets (December 2003 or March 2004) from which these six arrays have been excluded. Data were generated at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC). Over 300 brain samples from 35 strains were hybridized in small pools (n=3) to 106 arrays. Data were processed using the Microarray Suite 5 (<a class="fs14" href="www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/whitepapers/sadd_whitepaper.pdf">MAS 5</a>) protocol of Affymetrix. To simplify comparison between transforms, MAS 5 values of each array were adjusted to an average of 8 units and a variance of 2 units. In general, the MAS 5 transform does not perform as well as RMA, PDNN, or the new heritability weighted transforms (HW1PM).</p>
