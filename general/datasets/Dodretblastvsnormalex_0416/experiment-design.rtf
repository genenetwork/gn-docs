<p>Sample Processing: Dr. XiangDi Wang (UTHSC) and Becky King (Emory) were involved in the retinal extractions and isolation of RNA. The Affymetrix arrays were run by two different research cores: the Molecular Resource Center at UTHSC (Dr. William Taylor Director) and the Integrated Genomics Core at Emory University by Robert B Isett (Dr. Michael E. Zwick, Director). In a separate set of experiments we could not detect any significant difference in the arrays run at UTHSC or at Emory University.</p>

<p>Replication, sex, and sample balance: Our goal was to obtain data for independent biological sample pools from both sexes for most lines of mice. The four batches of arrays included in this final data set, collectively represent a reasonably well-balanced sample of males and females, in general without within-strain-by-sex replication.</p>
