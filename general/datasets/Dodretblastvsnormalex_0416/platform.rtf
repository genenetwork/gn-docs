<p>Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array: These expression arrays have been designed with a median of 22 unique probes per transcript. Each unique probe is 25 bases in length, which means that the array measures a median of 550 bases per transcript. The arrays provide comprehensive transcriptome coverage with over 30,000 coding and non-coding transcripts. In addition there is coverage for 592 microRNAs. For some arrays the RNA was pooled from two retinas and for other arrays were run on a single retina.</p>
