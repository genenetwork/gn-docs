<p>Read Mapping and Gene Expression Quantification RNA-seq reads were quality-trimmed using Trim Galore (31) and mapped to the mm10 reference genome or to the IAV PR8M genome using STAR (32). Counts were summarized at the gene level using the R-package Rsubread (33), normalized and log transformed using the R-package DESeq2 (34), and batchcorrected using the ComBat function of the R-package sva (35, 36). For annotations of genes, ENTREZID from Rsubread were matched to RefSeq annotations using R-package biomart (37).</p>
