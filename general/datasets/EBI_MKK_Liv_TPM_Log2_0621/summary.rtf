<p>Unraveling the relationship between genetic variation and phenotypic traits remains a fundamental challenge in biology. Mapping variants underlying complex traits while controlling for confounding environmental factors is often problematic. To address this, we have established a vertebrate genetic resource specifically to allow for robust genotype-to-phenotype investigations. The teleost medaka (Oryzias latipes) is an established genetic model system with a long history of genetic research and a high tolerance to inbreeding from the wild. Here we present the Medaka Inbred Kiyosu-Karlsruhe (MIKK) panel: the first near-isogenic panel of 80 inbred lines in a vertebrate model derived from a wild founder population. Inbred lines provide fixed genomes that are a prerequisite for the replication of studies, studies which vary both the genetics and environment in a controlled manner and functional testing. The MIKK panel will therefore enable phenotype-to-genotype association studies of complex genetic traits while allowing for careful control of interacting factors, with numerous applications in genetic research, human health, and drug development and fundamental biology. Here we present a detailed characterisation of the genetic variation across the MIKK panel, which provides a rich and unique genetic resource to the community by enabling large-scale experiments for mapping complex traits.</p>
