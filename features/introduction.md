# Introduction

GeneNetwork (GN) is unique web-service offering over 25 years of experimental mouse and rat data.
The bulk of the data reflects experiments on the 'immortal' BXD mouse model which means that experiments conducted 25 years ago can be reanalysed and compared with experiments today.

Powerful features of GN include searching for dataset, genes, SNPs and QTL in different species, as well as [live mapping](mapping.md) using advanced tools, such as R/qtl and GEMMA that include LMMs and allow for selection of cofactors.
GN can also compute correlations of data points and significant QTL.

Here we present features of GN and discuss current and future work.
