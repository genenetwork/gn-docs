# Introduction

GeneNetwork (GN) is unique web-service offering over 25 years of experimental mouse and rat data.
The bulk of the data reflects experiments on the 'immortal' BXD mouse model which means that experiments conducted 25 years ago can be reanalysed and compared with experiments today.

Here we present features of GN and discuss current and future work.
